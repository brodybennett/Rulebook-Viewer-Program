# Sequence 7: Serial Killer

## Serial Killer

> **Lore:** You have mastered many forms of demon-worship knowledge and ritual, and you like to please demons through special serial killings. Given enough time, you can summon demonic projections from the depths. You can effectively interfere with divination and channeling. [[id:alias-divination|Divination]] [[Channeling]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Agility +2, Constitution +2, Inspiration +2.
- Your Occult can be quickly promoted to proficient.

### Nether Disturbance

Whenever you kill a sentient being, if you make its body into a demon-pleasing artwork and draw the ritual symbol corresponding to the demon, you gain the following benefits:

1. Choose **1** item of specific mystic information related to you (for example: you plan to attack someone next). You then “realize anti-divination” and conduct a mystic identification, using the difficulty of the anti-divination as the difficulty of the mystic identification. [[id:alias-anti-divination|Anti-Divination]] [[Mystic Identification]] [[UNCLEAR: The exact procedure and what “realize anti-divination” means in play is not defined; the text ties mystic identification difficulty to anti-divination difficulty but does not specify the roll/check type.]]
2. After success, this information will be excluded in related divination, spiritual intuition, and prophecy unless the corresponding difficulty is exceeded. The spirit formed by the deceased himself cannot provide effective information, excluding the spirit body arranged in advance by the psychic. [[Spiritual Intuition]] [[id:alias-prophecy|Prophecy]] [[Psychic]] [[UNCLEAR: “Excluding the spirit body arranged in advance by the psychic” is grammatically unclear; it likely names an exception, but the exact scope of that exception is not explicit.]]

### Demon Burnt Offering

You have mastered knowledge and rituals related to demons. You can use sacrifices to please demons and gain benefits.

- This is essentially a special ritual magic.
- For the most basic process, see [[Common Ritual Magic]].
- You can pray to a high-ranking person of the abyss path for a response, and pray that the gods will default to the “dark side of the universe.” [[Abyss Pathway]] [[Dark Side of the Universe]] [[UNCLEAR: The text’s “pray that the gods will default to the ‘dark side of the universe’” is not clearly defined as a rule (target, effect, or limitation).]]
- **Special:** Unlike righteous gods, the ritual magic of the abyss will not be responded to unconditionally; sacrifices must be made to be favored.

**Pleasing Ritual**

The basis of all demon-worshiping rituals: you don’t expect anything in return, only to please the demon.

- **Process:** Based on general ritual magic, after confirming the current area is watched by demons, bring an intelligent creature to the ritual site and perform the most brutal “art” under the gaze of demons to please them.
- **Benefit:** Pleasing rituals bring no benefits, and the demon will not take the body or soul of its victims, but you gain the demon’s favor.
- **Sanity:** Completion of “Art” performed within the Pleasing Ritual causes you to instantly restore **1** additional sanity, based on intoxication. [[Sanity]] [[Intoxication]]
- **Follow-up:** Within **three days**, your next prayer will definitely be answered by this demon, even if there are no sacrifices, but the sacrifices you sacrifice in advance must meet the quantity requirements in advance. [[UNCLEAR: This appears to waive sacrifices for the next prayer while also requiring sacrifices “in advance”; the timing and “quantity requirements” reference is not defined here.]]
- **Flexibility:** You can change the pleasing ceremony into other ceremonies on the spot to pray for an immediate response.

> **GM Note:** After a pleasing ceremony is over, there will usually be an extremely horrified scene.

**Gift Ritual**

Demons who show interest and pleasure in you will give you special benefits.

- **Cost:** Sacrifice of at least **2** intelligent creatures.
- **Effect:** The demon will open a mottled and reddish bestowal door to you, or give you power directly.
- In your prayer, you state the benefits you want and choose **one** of the following effects to take effect:

  - **A dangerous reminder:** A piece of parchment tells you who is threatening you and the corresponding information in mystical words. Usually only the most threatening person is named, because the demon also wants to admire your struggle.
  - **The devil’s information:** Information the Extraordinary did not know; if not, it may provide information about things that would help you next, and tell you what you should do next. [[UNCLEAR: The conditions for when this instead becomes “what you should do next” are not mechanically defined.]]
  - **Knowledge of a crime:** Among the attack and crime skills obtained in [[Sequence 9]], choose a skill to increase by **one level**; it cannot exceed the advanced level. The devil bestows the corresponding knowledge into your mind through ravings.
    - Each acceptance of this knowledge requires a **Sanity roll**: 1/1d2. [[Sanity Roll]]
  - **A grant of power:** A demon-like spell of the Extraordinary, as a lower version of the [[id:alias-sequence-6|Sequence 6]] ability, which can be upgraded to the Sequence 6 level within **24 hours**.
    - To gain this benefit, you require an immediate **Sanity check**: 1/1d3. [[Sanity Check]]

- **Other requests:** The rest are in line with ritual magic and mentioned in the prayer (such as anti-divination, clearing curses, and cutting off the mystic connection between your own flesh and blood in the hands of others). In line with the most common ritual magic in [[Common Ritual Magic]], each response also requires at least **one** sacrifice. [[Curses]]

**Projection Ritual**

The demon you please decides to help you solve a difficult problem with its own hands.

- **Cost:** Sacrifices of at least **3** intelligent creatures.
- **Summoning effect:** The candles on the altar suddenly rise and turn into heat waves, forming a huge demon projection to fight for you within the scope of the ritual magic. [[Demon Projection]]
- **Persistence:** Demon projections have no health, but disappear once the altar of ritual magic is broken.
- **Protection model:** The demon projection protects the altar. You must pay **spirituality**, and the spirituality paid is treated as the damage the demonic projection can withstand while protecting the altar. [[Spirituality]]
  - For each intelligent creature sacrificed, the altar can withstand **+10** damage.
  - Once cumulative damage suffered exceeds the total the altar can withstand, the demon projection disappears immediately, and the ritual magic is also damaged.
- **Defenses while protecting the altar:** When protecting the altar, the projection is considered as a whole with the altar:
  - Physical defense: **15**
  - Will defense: **15**
  - “Has no effect on the ability of physical defense.” [[UNCLEAR: This clause is contradictory/unclear as written (it appears to restate or negate something about physical defense), and no clear mechanical interpretation is provided.]]
  - Damage reduction: **5**
  - Fire resistance: **5**
  - Cold resistance: **5**
  - Immunotoxin. [[UNCLEAR: “Immunotoxin” is not defined; it likely indicates immunity to toxins/poison, but the exact rule term is unclear.]]
- **Rank/pressure:** The person projected by the demon is considered a demigod (saint) and thus receives the benefit of [[Extra: Person Suppression]]. [[id:alias-demigod|Demigod]]
