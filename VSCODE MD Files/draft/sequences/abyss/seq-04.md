# Sequence 4: Demon

## Demon

- See also: [[Abyss Pathway]]

They are cunning and like to mislead others; they can make the lives around them fall into an inevitable psychedelic, and their emotions and desires will rapidly expand, or detonate their hearts, or destroy their reason, or bring about loss of control; the thinking ability of all nearby creatures will be significantly less error-prone; more malicious perception.

[[UNCLEAR: The overview states nearby thinking becomes “less error-prone,” but the ability “Stupid Aura” states nearby thinking is reduced and mistakes become easier.]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual (unofficial ceremony):** Make a demigod or a whole city-state a slave to their own desires, only act in accordance with their own heart, reveal their deepest malice without concealment, and you yourself become all of them the instigator, the devil in this depraved catastrophe; take the potion at the moment when everyone in the whole city fell into chaos or when the demigod caused serious disasters.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Agility +1, Constitution +2, Charisma +3, Inspiration +2.

### Stupid Aura

- **Use:** [[Free Action]] to enable or disable.
- **Effect:** The thinking ability of all nearby creatures will be significantly reduced, making mistakes easily.
- **Effect:** See your creature Inspiration and Education -4; this does not affect [[Spirituality cap]] and skill training.
- **Effect:** At the same time, as long as it is within the influence range of this ability, the points for [[Major Failure]] will increase to 1, 2, and 3.
- **Trigger:** Whenever there is a major failure, you can directly detonate the desire seeds in the target's body, allowing the seeds to mature instantly.
- **Aftereffects:** An additional [[Sanity Check]] of 0/1 is caused to the target.

### Devil

- **Effect:** Choose a limb, allowing you to maintain the shape of a [[mythical creature]] on this limb for a long time.
- **Use:** You only need a [[Free Action]] to choose a [[Spellcasting Action]].
- **Limits:** The free action can only be done once in a round, and cannot be changed within a day.
- **Effect:** Your [[Life Value]] extra +10; [[Spirituality]] +10.
- **Effect:** In addition to strengthening your physique, this can also allow you to display the strange runes unique to mythical creatures through this limb, which directly results in a sanity test equivalent to your [[Sequence promotion]].
- **Limits:** Anyone who has witnessed this scene and is not in the same position as you—enemies with different grids—will directly suffer the corresponding loss of sanity; each encounter is limited to one time.

[[UNCLEAR: “not in the same position as you—enemies with different grids” is not defined in RAW and may reference a separate faction/alignment or positioning rule.]]

### Cunning Man, Trickster

- **Effect:** Your social skills that have not reached the [[Proficiency level]] are considered proficient.
- **Effect:** You get an additional [[Identification]] bonus of +4.
- **Effect:** A social skill against its [[Will Defense]], you can force a person to act according to your will once a round, or make him unable to distinguish between illusion and reality.
- **Limits:** The latter presupposes the presentation of hallucinatory things.

> **Lore:** This usually allows you to solve a series of things very flexibly and plan, and even directly use a man leads to fall; this is usually in your hands, and will manifest in a malicious direction according to your will.

### Volcanic Eruption

- **Use:** A [[Full-round action]].

- **Effect:** You can act normally within the range of the eruption.
- **Limits:** The specific effect of this skill depends on the specific situation.
