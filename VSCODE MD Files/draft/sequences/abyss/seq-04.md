# Sequence 4: Demon

## Demon

- See also: [[LINK LATER: Abyss Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Pathway for Sequence 4 “Demon”]]

They are cunning and like to mislead others; they can make the lives around them fall into an inevitable psychedelic, and their emotions and desires will rapidly expand, or detonate their hearts, or destroy their reason, or bring about loss of control; the thinking ability of all nearby creatures will be significantly less error-prone; more malicious perception.

[[UNCLEAR: The overview states nearby thinking becomes “less error-prone,” but the ability “Stupid Aura” states nearby thinking is reduced and mistakes become easier.]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual (unofficial ceremony):** Make a demigod or a whole city-state a slave to their own desires, only act in accordance with their own heart, reveal their deepest malice without concealment, and you yourself become all of them the instigator, the devil in this depraved catastrophe; take the potion at the moment when everyone in the whole city fell into chaos or when the demigod caused serious disasters.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Agility +1, Constitution +2, Charisma +3, Inspiration +2.

### Stupid Aura

- **Use:** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] to enable or disable.
- **Effect:** The thinking ability of all nearby creatures will be significantly reduced, making mistakes easily.
- **Effect:** See your creature Inspiration and Education -4; this does not affect [[LINK LATER: Spirituality cap | type=mechanic | hint=resource limit]] and skill training.
- **Effect:** At the same time, as long as it is within the influence range of this ability, the points for [[LINK LATER: Major Failure | type=mechanic | hint=critical failure tiering]] will increase to 1, 2, and 3.
- **Trigger:** Whenever there is a major failure, you can directly detonate the desire seeds in the target's body, allowing the seeds to mature instantly.
- **Aftereffects:** An additional [[LINK LATER: Sanity Check | type=mechanic | hint=mental stability test]] of 0/1 is caused to the target.

### Devil

- **Effect:** Choose a limb, allowing you to maintain the shape of a [[LINK LATER: Mythical Creature | type=term | hint=transformations/runes]] on this limb for a long time.
- **Use:** You only need a [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] to choose a [[LINK LATER: Spellcasting Action | type=mechanic | hint=casting selection]].
- **Limits:** The free action can only be done once in a round, and cannot be changed within a day.
- **Effect:** Your [[LINK LATER: Life Value | type=mechanic | hint=health resource]] extra +10; [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource]] +10.
- **Effect:** In addition to strengthening your physique, this can also allow you to display the strange runes unique to mythical creatures through this limb, which directly results in a sanity test equivalent to your [[LINK LATER: Sequence promotion | type=mechanic | hint=advancement tier]].
- **Limits:** Anyone who has witnessed this scene and is not in the same position as you—enemies with different grids—will directly suffer the corresponding loss of sanity; each encounter is limited to one time.

[[UNCLEAR: “not in the same position as you—enemies with different grids” is not defined in RAW and may reference a separate faction/alignment or positioning rule.]]

### Cunning Man, Trickster

- **Effect:** Your social skills that have not reached the [[LINK LATER: Proficiency level | type=mechanic | hint=skill mastery tier]] are considered proficient.
- **Effect:** You get an additional [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=check/skill/stat]] bonus of +4.
- **Effect:** A social skill against its [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]], you can force a person to act according to your will once a round, or make him unable to distinguish between illusion and reality.
- **Limits:** The latter presupposes the presentation of hallucinatory things.

> **Lore:** This usually allows you to solve a series of things very flexibly and plan, and even directly use a man leads to fall; this is usually in your hands, and will manifest in a malicious direction according to your will.

### Volcanic Eruption

- **Effect:** From now on, you can cause a volcanic eruption disaster.
- **Use:** A [[LINK LATER: Full-round action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]].
- **Requirements:** Qualified environment.
- **Cost:** 10 points of spiritual consumption.
- **Effect:** You directly trigger a volcanic eruption, causing disasters covering a radius of at least ten kilometers.
- **Effect:** The volcanic eruption will bring thick volcanic ash and earthquake rockfall.
- **Effect (ongoing):** People in the disaster range will suffer +15 disaster attack identification against [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]] at the beginning of each round, causing 2d6 physical damage, 2d6 fire damage, and 2d6 poison harm.
- **Effect:** You can act normally within the range of the eruption.
- **Limits:** The specific effect of this skill depends on the specific situation.
