# Sequence 3: Blatherer

## Blatherer

- **Effect:** On a failed **Willpower Defense**, roll **1d4** to choose one listed outcome; the listener also suffers **1d6** Sanity / Rationality loss.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** (unofficial ceremony) Choose one:
  - Tempt a high-ranking being who knows the danger of the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]] to go to the [[Misty Sea]]; have them find the entrance to the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]] and take the initiative to fall into the embrace of the dark side of the universe.
  - Go to the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]] yourself, making no secret of your inner desire and the dark side for power, and take potions under the severe erosion of the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]].

> **GM Note:** The RAW explains the “essence” of this ritual as using words to tempt a high-ranking existence with interests—either tempting another being into madness, or “tempting” yourself (convincing yourself, despite knowing the danger, to pursue promotion and power even at the cost of your own safety and humanity). This is presented as rationale and thematic guidance, not additional mechanics.

- For details about the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]], see [[Chapter Twelve: Special Regions]].

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Strength** +2, **Agility (DEX)** +1, **Constitution** +2, **Intuition (INT)** +3.

### Babbling

- **Cost:** 1 point of **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** Free action; once per round.
- **Effect:** Make an **Intuition (INT)** test against each listener's **Willpower Defense**.
- **Effect:** Each time you utter a raving from the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]], the people present who hear your raving lose 1 point of **Sanity / Rationality** per round for **1 minute** after the last babble.
- **Effect:** On a failed **Willpower Defense**, roll **1d4** to choose one listed outcome; the listener also suffers **1d6** Sanity / Rationality loss.

- **Extra:** If someone establishes contact with you by using occult means such as [[id:alias-divination|Divination]] and [[Cursing]], you can negate the influence and reveal the source.

### Whisperer

- **Effect:** If a connection is established (GM decides), the ?Whisperer? can transmit their voice to the target?s ears across a very long distance, causing severe injuries rather than guaranteed instant death.

### Danger Countermeasure

- **Effect:** Your danger perception range covers a city.
- **Use:** If you sense a clear source of danger and pass an **Intuition (INT)** check against the target's **Willpower Defense**, you can directly use your extraordinary ability on the source.
- **Effect:** If you foresee the source of danger, you can reverse the influence by reflecting the effect back to the source.
