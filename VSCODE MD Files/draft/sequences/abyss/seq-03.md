# Sequence 3: Blatherer

## Blatherer

> **Lore:** Your voice and every word you speak can directly drive **Beyonders** to lose control, suffer severe injuries, become mentally confused, or have curses added to their bodies.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** (unofficial ceremony) Choose one:
  - Tempt a high-ranking being who knows the danger of the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]] to go to the [[Misty Sea]]; have them find the entrance to the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]] and take the initiative to fall into the embrace of the dark side of the universe.
  - Go to the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]] yourself, making no secret of your inner desire and the dark side for power, and take potions under the severe erosion of the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]].

> **GM Note:** The RAW explains the “essence” of this ritual as using words to tempt a high-ranking existence with interests—either tempting another being into madness, or “tempting” yourself (convincing yourself, despite knowing the danger, to pursue promotion and power even at the cost of your own safety and humanity). This is presented as rationale and thematic guidance, not additional mechanics.

- For details about the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]], see [[Chapter Twelve: Special Regions]].

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Strength** +2, **Agility** +1, **Constitution** +2, **Inspiration** +3.

### Babbling

- **Cost:** 1 point of **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** Free action; once per round.
- **Effect:** Make an **Inspiration** test against **Will Defense**. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW does not specify whose Will Defense is used (one target vs each listener vs another rule).]]
- **Effect:** Each time you utter a raving from the [[id:alias-abyss|Abyss]], the people present who hear your raving lose 1 point of **Sanity** per round. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW does not state how long this “per round” loss persists or what ends it.]]
- **Effect:** Your voice and every word you speak can make **Beyonders** who hear you lose control directly, suffer severe injuries, become mentally confused, or have curses added to their bodies. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW lists outcomes but provides no mechanical triggers, tests, or quantified effects for these outcomes.]]

- **Extra:** If someone establishes contact with you by using occult means such as [[id:alias-divination|Divination]] and [[Cursing]], you can immediately reverse the influence of ravings. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW does not define what “reverse the influence” entails mechanically.]]

### Whisperer

- **Effect:** If a connection is established, the “Whisperer” can transmit their voice to the target’s ears across a very long distance, causing the target to die violently in a safe place without knowing why. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW does not define how a connection is established, any costs/tests/limits, or the mechanical meaning of “die violently.”]]

### Danger Countermeasure

- **Effect:** Your danger perception range covers a city.
- **Use:** If you sense a clear source of danger and pass the corresponding **Inspiration** identification, you can directly use your extraordinary ability on the source. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW does not define what “Inspiration identification” is (test type, DC/target, or procedure).]]
- **Effect:** If you foresee the source of danger, you have the opportunity to reverse the influence on the spot. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW does not define what influence is being reversed here, or the action/test required.]]
