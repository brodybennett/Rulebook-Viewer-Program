  - [[Quick Learning]]
  - Sequence 9

### Inhuman Body

- **Effect:** You recover health much faster than others.
- **Natural recovery time:** The time required for your body to naturally restore life is only **10 hours**, **rounded up**. See [[Recovery of Spirituality and Other States]] for details.
- **Sequence scaling:**
  - **Sequence 7:** Changed to every **8 hours**.
  - **Sequence 6:** Changed to every **6 hours**.
  - Every time one level is promoted: the required time is cut in half and **rounded down**.

### Dehumanization

- **Effect:** From the moment you are promoted, you are no longer human. You still have feelings, but it is difficult to empathize; you will act only for your own desires, closer to pure egoism. Only in extreme cases is it close to emotional divinity.
- **Play guidance:** When playing, pay attention to the annihilation of humanity.
- **Condition impact (halved):** The effects of **Charisma (CHA)**, **Anger**, and **Fear** on you are **halved**.
  - You still have pure bloodthirsty and killing desires; this is not inconsistent with the halving of the anger state.
- **Forced/restrictive effects:** If these conditions have any special effect on you, such as forcing or restricting your actions, you can ignore such incidents.
- **Special:** Targets one level higher than you have the full effect on you normally.
- *(This is a potion benefit that cannot be recorded or stolen.)*
  - [[Charisma (CHA)]]
  - [[anger]]
  - [[Fear]]

- **Use:** 1 Casting Action.
- **Test:** Intuition (INT) vs. Willpower Defense.
- **Targeting and range:** Designate 1 target **within sight**.
- **Effect:** You raise your arms horizontally and press down your palms suddenly; the target’s body becomes heavy and their movement slows, as if the wings used to fly have been broken off.
- **Duration:** Lasting until the end of the target’s next action, they gain all of the following effects:
  - Their movement power is **halved**.
  - Their Agility (DEX) is **halved**, **rounded up**.
  - Their Dodge is **normal** (unchanged), which will affect the value of Physical Defense.
  - They take a **-2 penalty** on skill or ability checks against the Physical Defenses of others.
- **Sequence scaling:**
  - **Sequence 4:** Broken Wings can affect multiple targets at once. One Intuition (INT) Test is against the Willpower Defense of all targets.
    - If the target is one character lower than you, you can make them lose all mobility and agility, but it still does not affect Dodge.

> **GM Note:** Explanation about demon-like spells (Abyss Pathway)
>
> - In the Abyss Pathway, different races end up with different images of demons (e.g., goat demons, Cthulhu-like monsters, tentacles, or terrifying creatures like Shan Hai Jing).
> - Human blood is impure; people may be mixed with blood from other regions. The concept of “race” applies beyond humans and animals.
> - You can design a meaningful unique ability based on your character background (for customized demon-like spells).
> - All demon-like spells listed above are lower-level versions of Sequence 6 abilities; custom abilities will also have a more complete body mutation when reaching a higher Sequence. You can design an upgraded version in advance based on this idea.
