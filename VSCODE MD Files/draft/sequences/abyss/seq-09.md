# Abyss Pathway: Sequence 9

## Criminal

- See also: [[Abyss Pathway]]

> **Lore:** Also known as the “demon” Pathway, corresponding to the Tarot card “demon”. [[Tarot Card — Demon]]

> **Lore:** Unlike a prisoner, a “Criminal” does not suppress themself or feel restrained; body and mind are under the rule of evil desires. Their conscience has not been completely wiped out, and they are not cruel enough. “Criminals” are described as having a strong body, keen perception, and various criminal abilities—whether using knight swords, daggers, longbows, pistols, rifles, or six-barreled machine guns.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +2, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
- In addition, your fighting-related, weapon-use-related, throwing, and criminal skills can quickly grow to proficiency:
  1. Each time you receive 2 hours of corresponding guidance, or conduct 2 hours of corresponding training yourself, your corresponding skills increase by 1 level. It takes 2 times to be trained to be proficient, and only once per day.
  2. For details about criminal skills, see the same criminal skills of different Sequence 9. [[Criminal Skills (Sequence 9)]]

- When creating a character that has not just been promoted, you can use the relevant attributes brought by the potion as inspiration to add points for growth skills.
  - The attributes can only add points to your own related skills.
  - The Inspiration attribute itself can add points to any skills.

### Spirit Vision
- **Use:** 1 **Free Action** to activate.
- **Cost:** 1 **Spirituality Point** per round.
- **Effect:** While Spirit Vision is active, you gain the following benefits:


- You gain **Spirit Vision** through your Inspiration.
  1. **Etheric Body:** You can directly see the health status of the target through the color of the aura, and directly find out where the other party’s body is uncomfortable, where there is a problem, and it is specific to a certain organ.
  2. **Spiritual Body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality, which cannot identify extraordinary people.
  3. **Mental Body:** You can confirm whether the other person is thinking, but you cannot see more content.
  4. **Astral Body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5. When in the state of Spirit Vision, your [[Spiritual Intuition Test]] gains **+1 beneficial**.

- Notes:
  - Dead creatures are usually only dull in color and cannot be identified.
  - Spiritual materials usually have spirituality.
  - The color of the material in Spirit Vision usually represents its corresponding Pathway. This does not mean that you can directly read a Beyonder's power/Pathway details.
  - The color seen by Spirit Vision allows you to see each other in the dark, but you can only see the existence of color, and it is still possible to get lost in the dark.
  - Unlike dead creatures, undead creatures have deep black spirituality color instead of no color. [[Undead]]
  - Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default, which have not dissipated for 24 hours, and cannot be recorded or stolen.

### Perception of Depravity

- You are very sensitive to people who have fallen or are falling, and you can see black colors on them from your Spirit Vision.
- **Fall** is defined as fallen creatures or anyone who has violated public morals, no matter what they are for difficulties. [[Difficulty Value]]
- **Limits:** (Fallen Perception is a supplementary description to Spirit Vision, which cannot be recorded or stolen.)

> **Lore:** Example: There are actually a full one-sixth of the women in Backlund, the capital of Loen, who have worked as street girls, and there are also current female teachers among them. They are all forced to survive, and they have no choice but to do so in order to survive, but they are still considered depraved. [[Backlund]] [[Loen]]
>
> **Lore:** People from other countries will find that in such a conservative country as Ruen, the capital is full of street girls, and they all meet the requirements of the Sequence 5 ceremony of the abyss pathway. [[Ruen]] [[Abyss Pathway Sequence 5 Ceremony]]

### Intoxicated

- You are addicted to the thrill of crime.
- **Trigger:** Whenever you complete a criminal action.
- **Effect:** You restore a certain amount of [[Sanity]] according to the degree of the crime:
  1. Robbing others, stealing valuables: 1
  2. Illegally killing others and endangering public safety: 1d2
  3. Serious crimes such as killing, blasting, and robbing banks: 2d2
  4. **Perfect Crime:** On the basis of any of the above benefits +1 fixed value.
     - Conditions for a perfect crime: Any of the above-mentioned crimes has not been discovered, and has not been detected by the police or officials in the end, and has not spread.
- **Limits:**
  - Sanity points can exceed the upper limit, up to twice your sanity value.
  - Every 3 days (72 hours), the sanity beyond the upper limit will lose 1 point.
  - The sanity consumed beyond the upper limit will not be included in the value leading to madness. [[Madness]]

- **Special:** When dealing with the sanity loss of the [[Sequence 5 Promotion Ceremony]], only the second level of crime is valid, and the third level of crime is invalid.
  - Because every time you kill someone, you must perform a specific ritual: eat the internal organs of the other party after killing.
  - In the ritual state, the second level and above of the Intoxicated ability must be activated at least once every 3 days.
    - Repeated activation within these 3 days will change from restoring sanity to reducing sanity.

> **GM Note:** “Eat the internal organs” is presented as the required ritual component after killing, with the rationale that you must remain rational and not overindulgent during the bloodthirsty process.

### Domination of Evil Desires

- After taking the potion, your personality has changed, and your evil desires are more prominent than before.
- When there is a problem that needs to be solved, or an item that you covet, improper thoughts will flash in your mind, making you more inclined to solve or obtain it in a form that violates ethics, social order, and public good customs.

> **GM Note:** This is a play-by-play explanation; it will not bring about the effect of identification, but it can be used as an introduction to the plot if necessary.

### Killing Skills

- **Effect:** Your critical strike, double strike, proximity shooting, and other special action identification gains **+2 beneficial**, excluding first aid and surprise attack.
- **Limits:**
  - This does not affect special actions that simply gain benefits.
  - Momentum and aiming will not change from +2 to favorable (therefore not becoming +4); affects identification only.
  - This improvement cannot be recorded or stolen.

> **GM Note:** This is also described as an improvement brought by the potion, listed separately.
