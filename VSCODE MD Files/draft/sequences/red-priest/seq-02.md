# Sequence 2: Weather Warlock

## Overview

> **Lore:** A battlefield master of fog, storms, lightning, and change—able to alter weather across a wide area to gain an advantage in war.

- This entry is marked **incomplete** in the source.
- You possess the extraordinary ability of [[Frost Domain]].
- **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]] is spent to use the abilities in this section.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** In an obviously harsh environment where the battle situation and the environment are changeable, lead your army to escape from death, face all kinds of difficulties and dangers, and face the fierce changes in the weather without losing any comrades in arms, and persist until the end of the battle. The final result of the journey.  
  > **GM Note:** The source labels this as an “unofficial ceremony”.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Dexterity +2, Strength +2, Constitution +1, Inspiration +2.
- **Skills:** [[Occultism]] +1 level; [[Throwing]] +1 level.

### Celestial Alteration

- **Cost:** 10 **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** **full-round action** [[Full-Round Action]].
- **Effect:** You can alter the sky within a city. You change nearby celestial phenomena to your advantage.
- **Weather shaping:** Different weather changes can be applied repeatedly and combined to form new weather.

- **Weather options (examples):**
  - **Fog:** All vision is blocked. -8 to ranged attack checks; -5 to ranged damage checks, unless the fog is broken by other means.
  - **Thunderstorm:** Hidden thunder and dark clouds cover the entire sky; lightning damage rolls gain +1d10. Cold wind sweeps across the land; movement speed is halved.
  - **Squall:** The cold wind sweeps across the entire land, making it difficult for people to move an inch. Those who go against the wind will have half their movement power, while those with the wind will double.
  - **Blizzard:** The sky turns into a piece of “hoarfrost”, and visible snow quickly piles up on the ground. Those who couldn’t keep out the cold have -4 to all skill assessments, and their mobility is halved.
  - **Hailstorm:** Deals 1d4 damage per round to unprotected humans, on top of the previous snowstorm.
  - For other feasible weather changes, discuss with the **GM**.

#### Celestial Alteration — Extra

- **Cost:** 5 **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** **free action** [[Free Action]].
- **Effect:** Instantly intensify the on-site weather. All current weather effects are doubled and cannot continue to be superimposed.
- **Limits:** Subsequent additions to the weather require a separate Spirituality payment, and this ability can also be used together when released.

### Freezing Ice

- **Cost:** 5 **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** **spellcasting action** [[Spellcasting Action]].
- **Effect:** You condense a layer of frost on the largest area that can cover the city. Anyone who walks on it and performs a **move action** [[Move Action]] must make a **Dexterity test** [[Dexterity Test]]; otherwise, they lose their balance and fall directly.

### Frost

> **Lore:** You have been favored by ice.

- **Cost:** 3 **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** **attack action** [[Attack Action]].
- **Effect:** You can shape the frost into whatever you want. Make a [[Throwing]] (or other reasonable) check against the opponent’s [[Physical Defense]]. On success, deal 8d6 + your Strength damage bonus cold damage.

### Frozen

- **Effect:** Creatures within a radius of 10 kilometers from you are quickly wrapped in ice. Their actions are slowed by cold and ice: each **move action** can only move 1 meter.
- **Limits:** This effect has no effect on creatures with [[Cold Resistance]].
