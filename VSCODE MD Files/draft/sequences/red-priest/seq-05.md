# Sequence 5: Reaper

> **Lore:** A Reaper is skilled at finding a prey’s weakness and launching an absolutely fatal attack, with extremely strong offensive power.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Swear to resist in a fierce battle against your weakness—both material weakness and spiritual weakness—then take the potion. *(Unofficial ceremony.)*
- **During the ceremony:** The potion causes the **Extraordinary** to suffer both spiritual and material tortures. Their vital points as a living creature are torn in that moment; blood spurts as if the body is nearly torn apart, and the internal organs also suffer damage.
- **Requirement:** The **Extraordinary** must obtain strong enough willpower before this; otherwise, even if the body is reliable, they will eventually collapse and lose control after losing consciousness. [[LINK LATER: Lose Control | type=condition | hint=collapse/lose control after losing consciousness]]
- **After the promotion:** Although the injury is barely bearable, the better the **Extraordinary** maintains physical condition at the end of the ceremony, the easier it is to be promoted. Otherwise, even if they resist mentally, the **Extraordinary** will still fall down immediately after the promotion is completed, and may die due to physiological reasons.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +1, Agility +1, Will +2.
- All your [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9 skills | type=mechanic | hint=skills gained at Sequence 9]] can quickly grow to **Master**. [[LINK LATER: Master | type=term | hint=skill rank]]
- [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=term | hint=knowledge/skill category]] can be upgraded to **Erudition**. [[LINK LATER: Erudition | type=term | hint=upgrade tier for Mysticism]]

### Spot Weaknesses

> **Lore:** You are good at spotting the weaknesses of your prey.

- **Cost:** None (does not consume **Spirituality**). [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource points]]
- **Use:** 1 **Free Action**. [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Limits:** 1 time per **Round**. [[LINK LATER: Round | type=mechanic | hint=turn/round structure]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within your [[LINK LATER: Field of Vision | type=mechanic | hint=what you can see]].
- **Test:** Perform a [[LINK LATER: Detection test | type=mechanic | hint=test procedure]] with **Difficulty Value** 20. [[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=term | hint=standard test difficulty]]
- **Effect:**
  1. If the identification is successful, you immediately know the opponent’s weakness from a tactical point of view (e.g., darkness/corruption/undead creatures fear the sacred; plants fear poison; stone giants fear ice and fire). This does not mean you know the opponent’s creature type.
  2. At the same time, you learn which of the opponent’s existing [[LINK LATER: Resistance | type=mechanic | hint=resistance categories and how they work]] is the lowest. You do not know the specific resistance value—only which resistance is lowest (i.e., which attack is most effective).

### Harvest

> **Lore:** You discover the opponent’s weakness from the perspective of mysticism, and use this to launch a very powerful attack.

#### Weakness Attack

- **Cost:** 2 points of **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** 1 attack/casting/swift action that causes damage. [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Effect:** The various colors of the target’s body immediately appear in your eyes.
  1. The position representing the weakness is pale. This attack is **-8 disadvantageous**, and the damage caused is increased by 3d6. [[LINK LATER: Disadvantageous | type=mechanic | hint=the “-8 disadvantageous” modifier]]
  2. This is a **Vital Blow**, which cannot be superimposed with other **Vital Blows**. [[LINK LATER: Vital Blow | type=mechanic | hint=vital blow/critical location rules]] The weakness from this mystical point of view is not necessarily the internal organs and other locations.

> **GM Note:** Example: The weakness of the resentful soul may not be in the head, but a little above the Adam’s apple.

#### Fatal Attack

- **Cost:** 4 points of **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** 1 attack/casting/swift action that causes damage.
- **Effect:** The eyes will also appear in color.
  1. This strike has the effect of **Weak Point Attack** by default. [[LINK LATER: Weak Point Attack | type=mechanic | hint=weak point/weakness damage rule]] As long as it hits the opponent, no matter where it hits (even if it is armor), it is considered to cause a weak point attack.  
     (So as long as the identification > its "Agility + Dodge", even if it does not penetrate the armor, it can still cause 3d6 default damage.) [[LINK LATER: Agility | type=term | hint=attribute]] [[LINK LATER: Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=defense statistic]] [[LINK LATER: Armor Penetration | type=mechanic | hint=what counts as penetrating armor]]
     - But because the real damage does not penetrate, no matter how much damage you could have caused, it is only 3d6 at this time.
  2. On the basis of 1, you are considered to have performed a real **Critical Strike** special action, but this critical strike also only has a -8 disadvantage, and the effects of the **Vital Strike** special action can be superimposed with the weak point attack. [[LINK LATER: Critical Strike special action | type=mechanic | hint=critical strike procedure]] [[LINK LATER: Vital Strike special action | type=mechanic | hint=vital strike procedure]]

> **GM Note:** Example: The initial attack that will cause 1d6+2d6 damage can add +3d6 damage due to the weak point, but if it does not penetrate the armor while hitting the opponent, the 1d6+2d6 damage is invalid—only 3d6.  
> (If the armor is penetrated, the vital blow effect of internal organs will be superimposed, causing 1d6+2d6+3d6+3d6 damage.)

[[UNCLEAR: “identification > its 'Agility + Dodge'” uses “identification” as a threshold/check term that is not defined in this section.]]

#### Carnage

> **Lore:** You change your damage to area kills.

- **Trigger/requirement:** This is based on Weakness Attack/Critical Attack. When you perform either of these attacks, if you give [[LINK LATER: Doubled aura | type=mechanic | hint=the “doubled aura” state/effect]], it can cause a more lethal effect.
- **Effect:**
  1. Weak point attack: change to consume 4 **Spirituality**, and your single-target attack is changed to attack within 10 meters in front of you.
  2. Deadly attack: instead of consuming 12 **Spirituality**, on the basis of 1, the attack has the effect of fatal attack.
- (The main effect of Slaughter is to change single-target damage to group damage. If the ability you originally cast is group damage, then you must use Slaughter to enjoy the benefits of weak point/fatal attack; otherwise the ranged damage will not enjoy the harvest effect.)

[[UNCLEAR: “Carnage” is later described as “Slaughter,” and it references “Critical Attack” despite the options here being “Weakness Attack” and “Fatal Attack.”]]
