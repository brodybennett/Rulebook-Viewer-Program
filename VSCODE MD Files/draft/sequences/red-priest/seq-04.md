# Sequence 4: Iron Knight

## Iron Knight

> **Lore:** This Sequence hardens the body and will, grants mastery over steel and flame, and forges a special bond with an organized force.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- Form a team of **at least 30 people**.
- Cultivate deep friendship, grow strong, and cooperate with tacit understanding.
- Comprehend the meaning of “[[LINK LATER: Hunter | type=term | hint=the meaning of “hunter” referenced in the ritual]]” through one another’s eyes and movements.
- When the team is almost “one,” the ritual is formed.
- The higher the team’s strength and tacit understanding, the better the ritual’s effect.

## Extraordinary Abilities

  - You can also increase the **Hardness** of your body at the same time. [[LINK LATER: Hardness | type=term | hint=durability/toughness value]]
