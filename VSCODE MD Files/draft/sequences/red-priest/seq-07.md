# Sequence 7: Arsonist

> **Lore:** Known as a “Fire Mage” in ancient times, an Arsonist can manipulate flames flexibly.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Agility +1, Strength +1, Constitution +1, Inspiration +2.
- Mysticism is included in your [[Rapid Growth Range]] of Sequence 9, up to [[Proficiency]].

### Manipulation of Fire

You can control your fire flexibly and freely, shaping it into different forms for different strikes.

- This ability has the following uses:

1. **Condensed Fireball**
   - **Use:** 1 [[Casting Action]].
   - **Cost:** 2 [[Spirituality]].
   - **Effect:** Condense a crimson fireball in your palm, then throw it against [[Physical Defense]].
   - **Armor/overflow:** On resolution, it disintegrates and explodes; ignores 2 [[Armor]]. [[Overflow]] ignores the [[Identification Bonus]].
   - **Damage:** 2d8 fire damage.
   - **Sequence scaling:** At Sequence 5, the fireball expands to the size of a half-human; two creatures standing together are considered the same target.

2. **Blazing Lance**
   - **Use:** 1 [[Attack Action]].
   - **Cost:** 4 [[Spirituality]].
   - **Effect:** Condense a scarlet spear of pure flames surrounded by sparks and intense heat. Roll fire damage against [[Physical Defense]].
   - **Damage:** 2d8 + [[Strength Damage Die]].
   - **Resistance/overflow:** Ignores 2 points of [[Fire Resistance]] or [[Damage Reduction]]. Overflow ignores instead damage bonus.

3. **Flame Whip**
   - **Use:** 1 [[Attack Action]].
   - **Cost:** 2 [[Spirituality]].
   - **Targeting and range:** Choose a target within 2 meters.
   - **Effect:** Heat rolls over your torso and palms, forming a long flame whip.
   - **Damage:** 1d4 + half [[Strength Damage Dice]] (as written).
   - **Limits:** You can attack 3 times in 1 attack action; the second/third attacks are respectively -4 and -6 disadvantage.

4. **Fire Raven**
   - **Use:** 1 [[Casting Action]].
   - **Cost:** 2 [[Spirituality]].
   - **Effect:** Summon countless fire ravens.
   - **Limits:** The upper limit of fire ravens you can summon and maintain equals your Inspiration/2, rounded up.
   - **Targeting:** Mysticism against [[Physical Defense]].
   - **Damage:** 1d3 fire damage per fire raven.
   - **Identification rules:**
     - Every 6 fire ravens (called “fire crows” in the source text) is 1 [[Identification]].
     - The number of triggering substitutes/reductions = the number of Identifications.
     - Each fire raven can choose different targets.
     - 1 Identification is against the Physical Defense of all targets.
     - Ignores Agility and [[Dodge]] due to automatic enemy hunting (doesn’t work for [[id:alias-quick-dodge|Quick Dodge]]).

5. **Create/Manipulate Flames**
   - **Use:** 1 [[Swift Action]].
   - **Cost:** 1 [[Spirituality]].
   - **Effect:** Manipulate surrounding flames, or create flames, and change them into various shapes. You can achieve the following effects:
     - **Attach Fire:** Attach fire to any part of your body or weapon, increasing fire damage by 1d6. This does not stack with [[Fire Weapons]], so it is generally not as useful as other fire abilities.
     - **Manipulation of Flames:** Choose a flame within your field of vision and manipulate it into the shape you want. You need to maintain it all the time. If you choose the enemy’s flame ability, the ability can be shifted to the side, bringing a -4 disadvantage.

6. **Spreading Flame**
   - **Use:** 1 [[Casting Action]].
   - **Cost:** 3 [[Spirituality]].
   - **Effect:** Press your hands on the ground to spread flames; choose one effect:
     - **Create a Wall of Fire:** Choose an area up to 10 meters within your field of vision. Create a wall of fire that burns on all sides in this area. You must maintain it all the time, without continuously consuming spirituality. Passing through the wall of fire takes 2d6 fire damage.
     - **Spreading Flames:** Choose a direction within your field of vision to create a raging flame that spreads by itself. You can control the direction in which the flames spread; only the direction of spread needs to be maintained. After the flames, suffer 2d6 fire damage.
       Creatures the flames pass over suffer 2d6 fire damage.

7. **Flame Compression**
   - **Use:** 1 [[Swift Action]] per compression layer.
   - **Cost:** 1 [[Spirituality]] per layer.
   - **Effect:** You can compress flame to gain the following effects.
   - **Form of expression (visual):** 1st layer orange-red; 2nd layer red-white at the tip; 3rd layer completely red-white.
   - **Compression benefits (by ability):**
     - **Condensed Fireball:** Each layer +1d8 damage, Armor-ignore value +1; up to 3 layers.
     - **Blazing Lance:** Each layer +1d8 damage, resistance-ignore value +1; maximum 2 layers.
     - **Flame Whip:** Each layer +1d2 damage; maximum 2 layers; all layers can be enjoyed in one attack.
     - **Fire Raven:** Add 3 fire ravens per layer; up to 2 layers.
     - **Attach Fire:** Each layer +1d6 damage; up to 2 layers.
     - **Spreading Flame:** +1d6 damage for 1 layer; up to 1 layer; the premise of this benefit is that you keep the flames.
   - **Negative Effects:** Compressing flames brings pressure.
     - Each time you compress 1 layer, your [[Attack Identification]] is -1 (disadvantageous).
     - From the 2nd layer onward, your face turns red and you sweat profusely.
     - Flame spread does not require Identification, so you do not suffer this effect.
   - **Sequence scaling:**
     - **Sequence 6:** You no longer have pressure when you compress flame; even if you don’t compress it, all flames are considered compressed by 1 layer.
     - **Sequence 5:** When flame is not compressed, it is considered compressed by 2 layers; the upper limit of the compression layer of all flames is +1.

> **GM Note:** “Fire usage allowed by other moderators”—the GM may allow other applications of fire. The abilities above are essentially manipulating fire, so you can turn fire into other weapons as well, excluding complex heat weapons.

> **GM Note:** You can raise flames under your feet while attacking, thereby melting snow/soil secretly and avoiding attacks.

### Incarnation of Blazing Spear

(Granted at Sequence 5 per source text: “Your control over the flame has been improved.”)

- **Use:** 1 [[Attack Action]].
- **Cost:** 3 [[Spirituality]].
- **Effect:** Blaze heat waves from head to toe; the heat waves envelop you and turn into flames, casting your body into a blazing flaming spear. This is a melee attack.
- **Targeting and range:** Fight or throw against [[Physical Defense]].
- **Result:** Use the same damage and properties as **Blazing Lance** (red flame spear); it can also be compressed.
- **Displacement during attack:** After the throw, you will fly out directly, land and cause damage, then reorganize directly back into human form. This is considered [[Displacement]] while you are attacking and does not consume your [[Movement Action]].
- **Sequence scaling (Sequence 4):**
  - After turning into a blazing spear, the throwable range reaches a radius of 1 kilometer, equivalent to a certain kind of flight.
  - The “flying” speed after throwing is five times your [[Movement Power]].
  - After the spear falls to the ground, it will not hurt a piece of wood or a grain of dust.
  - You can let the flame collapse back to yourself immediately when it lands gracefully, without causing any damage.
