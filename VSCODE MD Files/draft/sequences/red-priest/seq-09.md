# Red Priest Pathway: Sequence 9

## Hunter

- See also: [[LINK LATER: Red Priest Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Pathway overview file]]

> **Lore:** The embodiment of war and pure masculinity, corresponding to the Tarot card “Chariot” ([[LINK LATER: Tarot - Chariot | type=other | hint=Tarot correspondence]]).

### Acting Rules

- The largest city is also the largest dark jungle.
- Here, everyone has two identities: prey and hunter.
- No matter how weak a hunter is, they are still a hunter—and may hurt powerful prey.
- Observe the environment, be familiar with the environment, and use the environment.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +1, Dexterity +1, Inspiration +1.
- All fighting-related skills increase by 1 level.

### Skill Growth

1. **Guided Training (1/day):** Each time you receive at least 2 hours of non-repetitive, effective guidance, **only once per day**, your skills corresponding to the guidance content increase by 1 level:
   - Fighting
   - Shooting
   - Tracking
   - Survival
   - Craft Manufacturing
   - Stealth
   - Detection
   - Throwing
   - Listening  
   This increase **cannot exceed Proficiency**. [[LINK LATER: Proficiency | type=term | hint=Skill cap / mastery tier]]

2. **Hunting Growth:** It takes **2, 3, and 4 times** to be trained to be **Proficiency, Advanced, and Proficiency** respectively.  
   [[UNCLEAR: The text repeats “Proficiency” for two different training thresholds, making the intended progression ambiguous.]]  
   Each time you successfully hunt an enemy stronger than you, it is also regarded as a skill growth. Choose any one of the above skills as the growth skill; apply the growth.

- Note on newly promoted characters and Inspiration:
  - It is not that a character who has just been promoted can use the relevant attributes brought by the potion (and corresponding to the skill) as Inspiration to add points to the growth skill.
  - The potion’s own Inspiration attribute can choose any skill to grow, regardless of whether the skill is inspired or not. [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=Attribute and/or advancement resource]]

### Law of the Jungle

- **Law of the Jungle:** An explanation that your hunting-related skills will be used more effectively.

1. **Survival (Difficulty Value 20):** On a Survival identification (Difficulty Value 20), you can judge:
   - Whether the environment is good/bad for your survival
   - Food channels
   - Whether food is edible  
   This includes cities. You can’t get information that lacks clues; **each clue is +2 beneficial**.

2. **Tracking (Difficulty Value 15):** On a Tracking identification (Difficulty Value 15), choose a clue or target. As long as the target does not cover up content related to the clue by RP before leaving, you can track the target’s action path along the way until the clue is disconnected due to extraordinary factors.
   - Can be used in lieu of [[LINK LATER: Spotting | type=skill | hint=Perception/spot skill]].
   - Can resist [[LINK LATER: Stealth | type=skill | hint=Hide/stealth checks]] checks against invisible/hiding creatures to spot targets, but you must first be aware of their presence.

3. **Listening (Difficulty Value 15):** On a Listening appraisal (Difficulty Value 15), you must know the target’s gait and voice before the appraisal, then choose the target you want to listen to. As long as the gait and sound corresponding to the target appear, you detect it immediately.

4. **Reconnaissance (Difficulty Value 15):** On a Reconnaissance identification (Difficulty Value 15), choose a target within your field of vision. On success, you remember some of their characteristics; the GM tells you what characteristics those are. Until the characteristics are covered or changed, you can recognize the target.

5. **Special Actions:** Special Actions such as [[LINK LATER: Critical Strike | type=mechanic | hint=Special Action]], [[LINK LATER: Double Hit | type=mechanic | hint=Special Action]], and [[LINK LATER: Proximity Shooting | type=mechanic | hint=Special Action]] are **+2 beneficial**, excluding [[LINK LATER: First Aid | type=mechanic | hint=Special Action]] / [[LINK LATER: Surprise Attack | type=mechanic | hint=Special Action]].
   - Does not affect special actions that simply gain benefits.
   - **+4, affects identification only.**  
   [[UNCLEAR: This item mixes +2 and +4 modifiers with exclusions in a way that does not clearly specify which checks receive which bonus.]]

> **GM Note:** As a hunter, there may be more skill usages; the above content corresponds to ordinary people who are proficient in skills.

### Trap Making

- You can place traps in an area. This area must be a relatively small room, difficult to move, or another suitable location for traps.
- **Use:** As a full-round action, you must reach the designated location and set a trap.

#### Trap Placement Conditions

1. The number of traps depends on your materials, and your materials depend on your [[LINK LATER: Reputation | type=term | hint=Reputation level/grade]]. If your reputation is not advanced, your trap upper limit equals your reputation level × 3. **Multiply by 5; Proficiency does not count.**  
   [[UNCLEAR: “Multiply by 5; Proficiency does not count” is not clearly tied to a stated condition (e.g., when Reputation is Advanced), so its trigger is ambiguous.]]

2. This does not mean you can arrange traps endlessly. If there is more than 1 trap in the same area, then for each additional trap, the difficulty of identifying the trap is **-2**.

3. When a creature that is not blind and can see the surrounding environment is close to the trap, it can use a **Difficulty Value 25** Detection / Survival / Crafting check to find the trap. If you are in the field or in the ruins, you can use **Difficulty Value 20** Geology and Archeology respectively instead.  
   [[LINK LATER: Detection | type=skill | hint=Perception/detection skill]]  
   [[LINK LATER: Geology | type=skill | hint=Field skill]]  
   [[LINK LATER: Archeology | type=skill | hint=Field skill]]

4. If the creature is a [[LINK LATER: Beast | type=term | hint=Creature type]] or an extraordinary creature (or extraordinary who has lost its mind), detecting the trap fails by default.

- A creature can only trigger **1 trap at the same time** (you cannot let a creature trigger multiple traps at the same time).

#### Trap Types and Resolution

- When you set up traps, you can choose the following:

1. **Triggering traps:** Craft Manufacturing identification is against the target’s [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=term | hint=Defense value used vs physical effects]] to determine whether the trap works. Restricted traps do not need identification if they are not detected, while damage traps still need identification.

2. If a damage trap is not detected, its Craft Manufacturing identification can ignore the agility and dodge in Physical Defense, and gain the benefits of [[LINK LATER: Sneak Attack | type=mechanic | hint=Combat benefit]] and [[LINK LATER: Surprise Attack | type=mechanic | hint=Combat benefit]]; identification **+2**.

3. The benefits of Surprise Attack and Sneak Attack are invalid for creatures that cannot be surprised or sneak attacked.

#### Restricted Traps

##### Warning Trap

- **Use:** Choose an area; set up warning traps in this area and choose a way for the trap to remind you there is a target (e.g., hang a bell, or a tied wine bottle that falls).
- **Effect:** Once a creature passes through the edge of the area in physical form (where the warning trap is located), the bell or wine bottle immediately reminds you that the trap is triggered.
- **Reset:** Whenever the warning trap is triggered, you must go to where it is placed and use a full-round action to reinstall it before it can be triggered again.

##### Capture Trap

- **Use:** Choose an area with a diameter ranging from **2 meters to 5 meters**; arrange capture traps.
- **Effect:** Once creatures arrive at the location of the capture trap in physical form, they are immediately restrained by you in the specified form (e.g., a net falling from the sky).
- **Breaking Free:**
  - Ordinary animals generally need **1 hour** to break free or cannot break free.
  - An intelligent or extraordinary creature can break free by passing a Strength test of **Difficulty Value 15**.
- **While Captured:** The creature cannot perform any attack or movement actions, but can perform spellcasting or swift/free actions.
- Capture traps can only be triggered once.

#### Injury Traps

##### Hunting Trap

- **Use:** Create a hunting trap no more than **0.5 meters to 1 meter** in diameter.
- **Effect:** Once a creature arrives at the location of the hunting trap in physical form, it immediately causes **2d6** physical damage.
- **Form Examples:** Triggered crossbow arrows, animal traps, and so on.
- **Leg Immobilization:** If the trap is similar to a trap, it is also considered to have delivered a vital blow to the leg; the creature must use an attack or spellcasting action to dismantle the trap, otherwise it cannot move.
- **Triggering Limits:** A creature can only trigger one hunting trap at the same time, but every movement action may cause it to trigger once.
- **Reset:** Each hunting trap must take a full-round action after being triggered to return to its untriggered state.

##### Explosive Trap

- **Use:** Must have one explosive first; each explosive trap can place at most one explosive.
- **Effect:** Once a creature arrives at the location of the explosive trap in physical form and performs an identification equivalent to the above description, the explosive detonates immediately, causing damage equivalent to that of the explosive.
- **Typical Damage:** Generally speaking, an explosive trap can cause **2d6** physical damage and **1d6** fire damage.
- **After Trigger:** Explosive traps cannot be recovered after being triggered. Once the explosion is considered raw material, it is blown into hard-to-collect fragments.

- **Special case (multiple dynamites):** The GM may allow multiple dynamites in a trap; each additional dynamite takes **10 minutes** to consume.
  1. Starting from the second explosive, for each explosive, Crafting **+2 bonus** on identification against Physical Defense.
  2. Every time there are **5 explosives** in total, a **Difficulty Value 20** Crafting appraisal is required, and it takes **10 minutes** to expand the trap.
  3. For blasting behavior of excessive explosives, the GM should properly restrict it—especially except at sea. Explosives are not a product that can be bought casually; sellers are usually wary of users causing trouble and drawing attention to themselves.

- Other reasonable and logical traps are allowed by the GM.

#### Manual Triggering and Self-Safety

- If you choose to trigger the trap manually when placing the trap:
  - Once in a round, only one swift action can be triggered at a time.

- You are familiar with your trap arrangement:
  - Unless there is a big failure, or the trap is passive, you will not trigger your own trap involuntarily.
  - You clearly remember the location, principle, and mechanism of your own trap.

#### Sequence Promotion (Trap Making)

- **Sequence 6:** It only takes 1 casting or attack action to set up a trap; you can designate a location without the setting process, and it is regarded as a trap immediately there.

- **Special (from now on):** Your traps gain some occult effects, and the damage vectors in the traps can be replaced with your different types of fire.
  1. **Hunting Trap:** Can be turned into fire damage (e.g., hidden rockets shot out when triggered).
  2. **Explosive Trap:** You can directly use your [[LINK LATER: Fireball | type=mechanic | hint=Spell/ability used as explosive]] or [[LINK LATER: Fire Crow | type=mechanic | hint=Spell/ability used as explosive]] to replace the bomb. They can also be compressed, but you must pay the spirituality cost of making and compressing them when placing them.
     - When the [[LINK LATER: Fire Raven | type=mechanic | hint=Spell/ability used as explosive]] is used instead of a bomb, if the Fire Raven is divided into three checks, at least one of the targets of the check must be the triggerer. Fireballs are similar to bombs and explode immediately when triggered.  
       [[UNCLEAR: The text uses both “Fire Crow” and “Fire Raven” for what may be the same ability, but does not confirm whether they are identical.]]
     - Regardless of the identification of the previous flame type, when used as a trap, they are uniformly replaced with a Crafting identification.
     - This kind of flame storage trap is only effective for **24 hours**; after 24 hours the flame cannot be maintained and disintegrates.  
       [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=Resource points used for abilities]]

### Quick Dodge

- **Quick Dodge:** You can dodge firearms.

1. When you face guns instead of light/lightning, you retain complete agility and dodge in Physical Defense.  
   [[UNCLEAR: “guns instead of light/lightning” is unclear as written; the comparison category is not defined.]]

2. When you face non-gun-like high-speed attacks, such as the flames of the Red Priest and the ice spear of the Witch.  
   [[LINK LATER: Red Priest | type=pathway | hint=Referenced Pathway/source of flames]]  
   [[LINK LATER: Witch | type=pathway | hint=Referenced Pathway/source of ice spear]]

3. For any attack whose described speed does not reach the level of a gun, unless it must be hit, you will not only lose your agility and dodge defense, but will also get an additional dodge bonus.  
   [[UNCLEAR: This sentence states you “lose” agility/dodge defense yet also gain an additional dodge bonus; the intended net effect is ambiguous.]]

- Note: When facing firearms, your extra evasion is invalid, but the original full agility and evasion defenses are still retained.

- Sequence scaling:
  - **Sequence 9:** Gain a level for additional evasion skills.
  - **Sequence 5:** The extra dodge skill is raised by one level.
  - **Sequence 4:** The extra dodge skill is raised by one level, and you can get extra dodge even in the face of firearms.
  - **Sequence 2:** The extra evasion skill goes up by one level.

- This is the benefit of the potion; it cannot be stolen or recorded.

### Vision

- You gain vision, but it is not as effective for you as your own Inspiration.

- **Use:** 1 free action.
- **Cost:** Consuming 1 spirituality point per round, you activate vision.
- **Effect (while active):**
  1. **Etheric body:** You can roughly tell whether the other party’s body is good or bad through the color of the aura, but you can’t get detailed information.
  2. **Spiritual body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality; this cannot identify extraordinary people.
  3. **Mental body:** You can see whether the other party is thinking, but only so; you cannot get more detailed information.
  4. **Astral body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5. When in the state of spiritual vision, your [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition | type=skill | hint=Intuition test]] test **+1 is beneficial**.

- Notes:
  - Creatures that are dead are usually dull in color and cannot be identified.
  - Spiritual materials are usually spiritual, but you cannot determine the corresponding path.
  - The colors seen by spirit vision allow you to see each other in the dark, but you can only see the existence of colors; it is still possible to get lost in the dark because the colors you can see are limited.
  - You cannot use the colors to distinguish undead biology.

- Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default (which have not dissipated for **24 hours**) and cannot be recorded or stolen.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The text alternates between “vision,” “spiritual vision,” and “Spirit Vision” without clearly defining whether these are identical states or distinct abilities.]]
