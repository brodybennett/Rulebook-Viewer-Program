# Sequence 8: Trickster

> **Lore:** Scammers take pleasure in deceiving others and can create illusions to deceive opponents.

## Advancement

- Each time you complete a **non-repetitive, challenging** swindle or deceit, choose any one skill (persuade/talk/please/deceive) that is primarily used in the swindle; that skill increases by 1 level.
- The same as the promotion of Sequence 9. [[Sequence 9]]
  - Bullying the weak does not meet the promotion requirements.
  - The promotion range, and the level that can be promoted to, are equal to the promotion of Sequence 9’s master/detection. [[master/detection]]  
    [[UNCLEAR: “master/detection” is not defined here, so the exact reference for “promotion range” and “level that can be promoted to” cannot be resolved.]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Dexterity** +2, **Constitution** +1, **Inspiration** +1.
- Your **Persuasion**, **Speech**, **Pleasing**, and **Intimidation** skills increase by 1 level.

### Charisma

- **Effect:**
  1. Whenever you make a **Charisma**-related skill check, you gain a temporary +2 bonus to **Charisma** (this does not affect your appearance).
  2. At the same time, the relevant attributes of your **Intimidation** test can be replaced by **Charisma**.
     - Any of the above benefits will disappear for people who perceive your true face.
     - If you are not lying or deceiving, you will not enjoy the benefits for people who mistakenly think that you have evil intentions.  
       [[UNCLEAR: The trigger and scope of “mistakenly think that you have evil intentions” is unclear in how it disables the benefits.]]
- **Limits:** (This is the effect brought by 1 potion and cannot be recorded or stolen.) [[potion effect recording/stealing]]

### Extraordinary Eloquence

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action** [[Casting Action]]
- **Cost:** 2 points of **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]]
- **Check:** Any social skill check against **Will Defense** [[Will Defense]]
- **Targeting and range:** This affects all targets who hear the words.
- **Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits to apply:
  1. You need to state a point of view in a form that matches the characteristics of your identification skills. [[identification skills]]  
     Afterwards, the target who hears your speech will feel that your speech is very reasonable and calm down. You choose any one of the mental states of fear, anger, charm, temporary madness, etc., and immediately terminate it; this does not include shock, extraordinary madness, uncertain madness, etc.  
     [[mental states]]
  2. You express a point of view, and the target who hears the point of view must believe it, but every time they hold a clue that is contrary to your point of view, they can use **Detection** [[Detection]] to counter your social identification results to detect the clues, and any vigilant and hostile target is invalid.  
     [[UNCLEAR: “any vigilant and hostile target is invalid” is unclear as to whether such targets are immune, excluded from targeting, or invalidate the effect entirely.]]
- **Special:**
  - For every 1 clue, **Scouting** +2 is beneficial. [[Scouting]]
  - If the target knows very well about things related to the point of view, it is also invalid.  
    [[UNCLEAR: How “Scouting +2 is beneficial” modifies the resolution and what becomes “invalid” is not fully specified.]]

### Misleading Thinking

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action** [[Casting Action]]
- **Cost:** 2 points of **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target.
- **Check:** Cheats against **Will Defense** [[Will Defense]]
- **Effect:**
  1. You need to express your point of view in words before using the ability, and then you equate two things with the same affix.
  2. Things that are equated with the same affixes cannot have contradictory affixes at the same time. For example, apples and pears are both fruits, so apples can be equal to pears, but water cannot be equal to fire, living things cannot be equal to dead things, nobles cannot be equal to vagabonds Chinese.
     [[UNCLEAR: The phrase “vagabonds Chinese” appears malformed; meaning cannot be resolved from context, retained verbatim.]]
  3. Relying on the above content as a benchmark, whether the equal sign is established or not is determined by the **GM**. Once established, within 1 round, the target affected by you must believe it is true. After 1 round, if they find that the two things are not completely consistent, the effect will be cancelled.
- **Special:** This does not affect things that the target knows very well, and things that are important; some skills are proficient as a standard. For example, you can't tell a pharmacist who is proficient in pharmacy that cold medicine is equal to painkiller, unless the medicine is similar in curing certain diseases.
  [[UNCLEAR: “some skills are proficient as a standard” is unclear as a mechanical threshold for immunity/invalidity.]]

### Mind Disturbance

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action** [[Casting Action]]
- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target.
- **Effect:** You create 1 hallucination.
  1. You create an illusion with fully customized content. Only when the other party recognizes that it may be an illusion can they use **Detection**/**Inspiration** against **Deception** [[Deception]] to detect that the illusion is false. Therefore, this usually only works for the same target 1 time.
     [[UNCLEAR: “usually only works … 1 time” is vague—unclear whether this is a hard limit or a typical outcome.]]
  2. Unlike the magician's hallucination, the magician's hallucination will make all the existences within 10 meters see the false image, but the trickster's mind disturbance does not have this range limit. In contrast, the trickster's hallucination can only make one person see.
     [[magician’s hallucination]]
- **Special:** More than 1 person perceives false illusions by default, and other people can fight against false perception once they are alert to hallucinations.
  [[UNCLEAR: This “Special” appears to conflict with “can only make one person see,” and the exact rule interaction cannot be resolved.]]

### Quick Dodge

- **Effect:**
  1. When facing guns, you fully retain the agility and dodge in **Physical Defense** [[Physical Defense]], which does not include light and lightning. [[light and lightning]]
  2. When you face an attack that is slower than a gun, you can dodge more quickly, and you get an extra level of dodge. [[dodge levels]]
- **Limits:** (This is the effect brought by 1 potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.) [[potion effect recording/stealing]]
