# The Error Path Pathway: Sequence 9

## Thief

> **Lore:** Not a thief, but a thief—a fraudster. The dream is to steal people’s hearts, steal spells, cheat rules, and cheat fate, and all of this starts with stealing things from others. It is difficult to distinguish these extraordinary people from ordinary thieves. Maybe they are more powerful in their methods, and their purpose of stealing property is not for enjoyment or survival, but more like fulfilling a mission.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +2, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
- You can skillfully master observation and stealing skills.

1. Whenever you perform a challenging, non-repetitive stealing behavior and the stealing is successful, you can choose one of the skills of detection/skills to increase by 1 level. The things you steal must be valuable to the owner. [[UNCLEAR: “skills of detection/skills” is ambiguous (a category name, two categories, or a translation artifact).]]
2. Still, bullying doesn’t count. Stealing from beings weaker than you isn’t challenging. A thief’s dream is to steal hearts, steal spells, cheat rules, and cheat fate. Stealing is more like fulfilling a mission.
3. It takes 2, 3, and 4 times from training to proficiency, advanced level, and proficiency respectively. By analogy, the most proficient is the most. [[UNCLEAR: The tier names repeat “proficiency,” making the intended progression unclear.]]
4. When directly creating a character with a higher Sequence, the growth skill can be added twice as much as the inspiration of the potion to make up for the gap in growth. [[UNCLEAR: The comparison “twice as much as the inspiration of the potion” does not specify an unambiguous numeric procedure.]]

### Agile Hands

The stability and dexterity of your wrists and fingers are enhanced, which is the essence of power.

- **Effect:**
  1. Once per round, you can use a **free action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] to perform an action that identifies the skill as a master. This action is usually an attack/casting action. If it is a **full-round action** [[LINK LATER: Full-Round Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]], it is changed to an attack/casting action. [[UNCLEAR: “an action that identifies the skill as a master” and the conversion of a full-round action are not mechanically precise.]]
  2. Whenever you make an **identification** [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=check/test procedure]] related to the flexibility and stability of your fingers and wrists, your identification +2 is beneficial.
  3. You can better learn skills related to the flexibility and stability of your fingers and wrists. Whenever you learn this aspect, as long as the knowledge is true and effective, and the learning time exceeds 2 hours, your corresponding skills will increase by 1 grade.
- **Limits:**
  4. You can only study once a day, and you need to be trained 2, 3, and 4 times to be proficient, advanced, and proficient respectively, and you can reach proficiency at most. [[UNCLEAR: The tier names repeat “proficient/proficient,” and “reach proficiency at most” conflicts with listing “advanced.”]]

**Skills related to the flexibility and stability of fingers and wrists:**
- Fighting (hand-to-hand combat)
- Shooting
- Skillful hands
- Locksmithing
- Other skills (same category)

**This generally does not include:**
- Grappling
- Grappling (giant weapons)
- Shooting (rifles)
- Etc.

### Excellent Observation

Your observation and inspiration are more unique.

- **Effect:**
  1. You can sense valuables within 10 meters from you as the center, and you can distinguish the degree of value and the approximate location of the items. This does not include the Extraordinary characteristics in the **Beyonder**, but includes unused Extraordinary characteristics, Extraordinary items, etc. [[LINK LATER: Beyonder | type=term | hint=setting/character type]]
  2. Although you can perceive the existence of valuables, you can’t know what it is unless it is directly exposed to your eyes. Otherwise you can’t distinguish the shape, form, and whether it is extraordinary; you can only judge according to its value.
- **Special:**
  - The standard of valuables is determined by the society in which they live. As long as they are generally considered valuable, they have value.
  - Things like diamonds can be perceived as long as they are recognized by society, but fakes, fakes, and shoddy goods can also be judged come out.
  - (This cannot be recorded or stolen, Player can actively apply for triggers to relieve GM pressure, and will be affected by anti-divination.) [[LINK LATER: Anti-Divination | type=mechanic | hint=counters “affected by anti-divination”】【UNCLEAR: The trigger/GM-pressure clause and how anti-divination applies are not defined here.]]

### Steal

You can easily steal items from the target’s pocket without being detected.

- **Cost:** 2 points of **spirituality** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource points]]
- **Use:** 1 **spell-casting action** [[LINK LATER: Spell-Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]; perform 1 contact stealing behavior.
- **Effect:**
  1. Skilled against physical defense, ignoring Agility and dodge for unwarranted targets, you steal the opponent’s items. As long as you touch the items, you can succeed, and usually you will not be discovered unless extraordinary means are involved. [[UNCLEAR: “unwarranted targets” and the exact meaning of “ignoring Agility and dodge” are not defined here.]]
  2. Not to be discovered does not include the discovery of lost items afterwards, as well as the corresponding suspicion and investigation; only the process of stealing is not discovered.
  3. If the stolen item is an Extraordinary item, choose the one with the highest Sequence level of the item and the owner. For every Sequence higher than yours, your identification will be disadvantaged by -2. If the character is higher than you, then it will be disadvantaged by -2 and the **big success** [[LINK LATER: Big Success | type=mechanic | hint=critical success category]] will be ignored. [[UNCLEAR: The stacking/selection procedure and what qualifies as “the character is higher than you” beyond the prior clause are unclear.]]
  4. If the stolen item has no owner (it is not currently carried or held, and the item that is not on the body is ownerless):
     - If the ownerless item is an ordinary item, the stealing identification is successful by default.
     - If it is an extraordinary item, it is changed to **Difficulty Value** 15. Determine whether you succeed. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether this is a DV 15 identification check, a different check, or a flat success test.]]

**Sequence scaling:**
- Sequence 8: You no longer need to touch. You can directly transfer objects within 10 meters of your field of vision to your hand. If it is blocked by an object, as long as you can confirm the approximate location of the object, you can also let it come across the barrier to your hands. [[LINK LATER: The Error Path Pathway: Sequence 8 | type=sequence | hint=“Steal” range upgrade]]
  - Stealing from a distance still requires stealing postures, such as closing five fingers, holding objects virtual, and twisting wrists.
- Sequence 7: Your Steal range is increased to 30 meters. [[LINK LATER: The Error Path Pathway: Sequence 7 | type=sequence | hint=“Steal” range upgrade]]
- Sequence 6: Your Steal range is increased to 50 meters. [[LINK LATER: The Error Path Pathway: Sequence 6 | type=sequence | hint=“Steal” range upgrade]]
- Sequence 5: Your stealing range is increased to 100 meters. [[LINK LATER: The Error Path Pathway: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=“Steal” range upgrade]]

### Ritual Mastery

You gain access to ritual magic, able to invoke power from the gods.

- **Effect:**
  - While holding this ability, you gain access to ritual magic, regardless of whether your occult skill is advanced or not. [[LINK LATER: Occult Skill | type=term | hint=skill prerequisite referenced here]]
  - For the ritual magic you can use, refer to [[LINK LATER: Common Ritual Magic | type=ritual | hint=shared ritual list]].
- **Limits:**
  - (This is the effect brought by 1 potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.)

### Spiritual Vision

You have obtained a more outstanding spiritual vision because of your inspiration.

- **Use:** 1 **free action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]
- **Cost:** 1 **spirituality** point per round
- **Effect:** When activated, your vision gains the following benefits:
  1. **Etheric body:** You can directly see the health status of the target through the color of the aura, directly find out where the other party’s body is uncomfortable, where there is a problem, and when it comes to a certain organ, you can see the inside through the unthickened door, confirm the number of people inside. [[LINK LATER: Etheric Body | type=term | hint=spiritual-vision layer]]
  2. **Spiritual body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality (this cannot identify extraordinary people). You can also penetrate the door to see the inside, and identify whether there is ritual magic power in it. This can penetrate the spiritual wall. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Body | type=term | hint=spiritual-vision layer]] [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Wall | type=mechanic | hint=barrier referenced here]]
  3. **Mental Body:** You can see the color represented by the other person’s emotions, but you can only see a general content. For example, you can know whether the other person is depressed or uneasy. This kind of negative emotion is usually a dark tone. [[LINK LATER: Mental Body | type=term | hint=spiritual-vision layer]]
  4. **Astral body:** You cannot see the astral body. [[LINK LATER: Astral Body | type=term | hint=spiritual-vision layer]]
  5. When in the state of spiritual vision, your spiritual intuition test +2 is beneficial. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition Test | type=mechanic | hint=test referenced here]]
- **Note:**
  - Dead creatures are usually only dull in color and cannot be recognized.
  - Spiritual materials usually have spirituality.
  - The color of the material in the spiritual vision usually represents its corresponding Pathway. This does not mean that you can see the power of a Beyonder Pathway.
  - The color seen by the spirit vision allows you to see each other in the dark, but you can only see the existence of color, and it is still possible to get lost in the dark.
  - Unlike dead creatures, undead creatures have deep black spirituality color instead of no.
  - ——Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default, which have not dissipated for 24 hours, and cannot be recorded or stolen.
