# Sequence 7: Cryptologist

A Cryptologist can analyze many mysteries (such as dreams and illusions) and can also determine an enemy’s location through analysis.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Dexterity +1, Constitution +1, Inspiration +2.
- Your **Occult** and **Detection** skills increase by 1 level.
- Whenever you complete a decryption of extraordinary events, your **Occult** increases by 1 level.
- If no extraordinary events are involved, your **Investigation** increases by 1 level.
- These two types of events must be more complicated and challenging.
  - The standard is whether the event may bring danger to you.
  - Events that are too monotonous and ordinary are not included in the corresponding category.
- This kind of improvement can at most reach proficiency.

### Premonition of Danger

Also known as intuitive premonition. You can predict others’ actions at critical moments and perceive danger.

- **Use:** Triggered whenever you are raided, sneak attacked, or there is something on the scene that is about to put the raid or sneak attack into action.
- **Use:** If 1 damage exceeds half of your maximum health (rounded up), this ability can also be triggered.
- **Effect:**
  1) Make an Inspiration appraisal (**Difficulty Value** 15). If you succeed, an idea flashes in your mind immediately, telling you the form of danger.
     - After you succeed, you will not be able to be raided or ambushed.
     - Threats that you mistakenly think are “safe” will not trigger this ability.
  2) Under the above premise, as long as you are not restrained or affected by other reasons, your **physical defense** gains a +4 **temporary bonus**.
     - In the face of light and lightning, you will retain the agility and dodge in physical defense instead of +4 added value. [[UNCLEAR: How “retain the agility and dodge in physical defense” replaces the +4 bonus is not mechanically defined.]]
  3) If the danger range is large enough (for example, a gas explosion in the entire area in an instant), even if you are alarmed by the danger, you will not be able to gain benefits.

- **Special:**
  - Dangers higher than 1 level cannot be foreseen.
  - Hazards dependent on luck are foreseeable but gain no benefit.
  - Danger premonition is a kind of spiritual intuition, so it is invalidated by [[LINK LATER: Anti-Divination | type=mechanic | hint=effects that block divination/intuition]] and [[LINK LATER: Anti-Prophecy | type=mechanic | hint=effects that block prophecy/intuition]].

- **Sequence scaling:**
  - **Sequence 6:** Your Inspiration appraisal is successful by default, and the flashing thought becomes a flashing picture, letting you know the manifestation of danger. [[LINK LATER: Sequence 6 | type=sequence | hint=Premonition of Danger upgrade]]
  - **Sequence 5:** You can perceive danger higher than 1 personality. [[UNCLEAR: “higher than 1 personality” is not defined (stat name/threshold unclear).]] [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=Premonition of Danger upgrade]] [[LINK LATER: Personality | type=term | hint=attribute/stat referenced by danger perception]]

### Decryption

You can analyze many mysteries (such as dreams and illusions), and you can also find out an enemy’s location through analysis.

- **Use:** 1 **casting action**
- **Cost:** 3 **spirituality points**
- **Effect:** Choose 1 of the following effects:

  ① **Detection and appraisal** (**Difficulty Value** 20): Choose a clue. You learn:
  - The information represented by the clue.
  - Whether it involves an extraordinary event.
  - A rough answer at Difficulty Value 20.
  - Each time the appraisal exceeds 5 points of appraisal difficulty, the content you get becomes clearer.

  ② **Detection test** (**Difficulty Value** 30): Choose a creature. You reveal its full name, identity, and other people’s nickname or nickname for it.
  - This test must obtain any of the following clues to proceed:
    - Know what other people call it / nickname / first name / surname.
    - Know its general experience, past, or identity information, or important things.
    - Witness 1 full episode of its actions in any event, or any 1 occasion where (based on its personality) it is emotional, uttered, or overly calm.
    - Other possible clues.
  - Once there are 3 clues above, the identification is successful by default.
  - For every 1 clue, your detection identification gains a +2 favorable bonus.
  - The content of obtained clues must be true. If it is contrary to the truth, it is a disguise, and what you get will also be false information.

  ③ **Detection appraisal** (**Difficulty Value** 35): You restore the complete truth of a matter and calculate the next development and result of this matter.
  - Each time you have a clue whose meaning you already know, your detection appraisal gains a +2 beneficial bonus.
  - Clues include the real names, identities, and general past of the people involved in the incident (each clue in ② is calculated independently).
  - If you do not truly grasp all the clues, the restored truth is also incomplete truth, and there will be some false content.

- **Special:** The truth that can be restored includes:
  - The extraordinary path of a creature,
  - The specific effect of an extraordinary ability,
  - The type of extraordinary ability,
  - The map of an area,
  - The principle of a maze,
  - Etc.
  - There will be no unknown unknowns in the restored truth clue. [[UNCLEAR: The final sentence is self-contradictory/grammatically unclear; the intended restriction on “unknown unknowns” is not precisely defined.]]

- **Other uses of ①:**
  - Distinguish between hallucinations and falsehoods.
  - Reveal the meaning of hallucinations or dream content.
  - Reveal the type of extraordinary ability that a clue may represent (such as illusion, flame, ability strength, etc.).
  - Judge whether the caster is far stronger or weaker than your own.

- **About Decryption:**
  - Decryption is not a kind of [[LINK LATER: Divination | type=mechanic | hint=divination category]]. It is pure deduction in the mind.
  - Therefore, Decryption ignores [[LINK LATER: Anti-Divination | type=mechanic | hint=effects that block divination/intuition]] and [[LINK LATER: Anti-Prophecy | type=mechanic | hint=effects that block prophecy/intuition]], and generally does not arouse spiritual responses. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Responses | type=mechanic | hint=system for backlash/feedback from spirituality]]

- **About Anti-Divination:**
  - You can use one Decryption skill and choose one item of specific mystical information related to you (for example: you plan to attack someone next) to realize anti-divination.
  - Conduct detection and appraisal, and set it as the difficulty of anti-divination. [[UNCLEAR: Whether this sets the anti-divination Difficulty Value equal to the check result or uses the same stated Difficulty Value is not specified.]]
  - When successful, this information is excluded in related divination, spiritual intuition, and prophecy unless it exceeds the corresponding difficulty.
