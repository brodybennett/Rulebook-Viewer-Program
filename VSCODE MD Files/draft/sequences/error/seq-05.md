# Sequence 5: Dream Stealer

## Dream Stealer

- This **Sequence** allows you to steal other people’s memories.
- You can also steal ideas the other party is about to put into practice, causing them to appear briefly sluggish—but you must take the corresponding action instead of the stolen object.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Steal the most important things from others, understand the source, value, and sustenance of things, make these things a part of yourself, and take potions after the things become your important things. (Unofficial rituals)
- **Function:**
  - After taking the potion, you will lose your obsession, dreams, and emotions.
  - The Extraordinary’s own most real dreams, missions, and responsibilities will be stolen, causing the Extraordinary to lose control.
  - Because these are disappeared, promotion needs false feelings from others as a substitute, so that the emotions from others can replace one’s own vision, replace one’s real emotions to be stolen, and complete a “fraud” of the potion.

> **GM Note:** The downside of this ritual is that if the emotion from others is strong enough to overwhelm your own mission, you may have self-doubt, and two different visions may conflict (for example, a murderer won a doctor vision). Considering that the goal of the ritual is to allow oneself to truly pursue these things, rather than simply self-delusion, this could lead to a new understanding of one’s calling, but at worst could also lead to a loss of control.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Intuition (INT) Intuition +2, Agility (DEX) Agility (DEX) +1.
- Your Mastery [[Mastery]] and Occult [[Occult]] can be quickly promoted to Master [[Master]].

### Stealing Thoughts

- **Cost:** Consume 3 points of spirituality [[Spirituality]].
- **Use:** 1 Casting Action Casting Action. To use the ability, you need to close your fingers and twist your wrist.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within 50 meters. Skillfully defend against Willpower Defense Willpower Defense.
- **Effect:**
  - You steal an idea the other person is about to act on, causing them to freeze briefly.
  - This ability can directly interrupt an action that has not been completed.
  1. If the target you have stolen is about to perform any free/casting/attack/moving action, and you make the corresponding action fail immediately, the target will appear sluggish on the spot and forget what they want to do, and the action they originally performed is up to you instead of completing.
  2. Example: If the other party wants to use the Attack Action to shoot, you must also shoot after stealing the idea. If you don’t have a gun, you will make the action of shooting instead. Even if you don’t have a gun in your hand, you will still pull the “trigger,” although nothing will happen.
  3. The action you perform instead is regarded as your extra action and will not consume your existing spellcasting/attack. However, the skill you use must use the skill level of the original owner of the idea, and the attributes still depend on yourself.
  4. If the owner of the original thought is to shoot at you, after stealing, you will not shoot at yourself, but shoot at an enemy you choose. But if the original thought wants to commit suicide, then you will also commit suicide.
     - But in this case, you don’t have to steal it, because the idea you have stolen must have been planned to take action; otherwise, you will not take action.
     - The premise of committing suicide is that the original owner of the idea really has the courage to commit suicide, and really will pull the trigger on themself.
  5. If the target you steal doesn't intend to do anything, then instead they lose 1 next attack/cast/Move Action, and you get no extra action.
     - If the target intends to use a extraordinary ability, but you don't have that ability, you will only make a gesture, not cast it.
- **Special:**
  - Both the target of the stolen idea and the target of the execution of the idea are considered to be in a bound state [[Bound State]] and last for the corresponding action time.
  - During this period, actions that can be executed faster than the corresponding action ignore the agility and dodge of the bound target.
