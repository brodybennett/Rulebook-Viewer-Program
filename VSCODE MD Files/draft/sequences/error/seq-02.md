```




- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** A Casting Action that attacks the opponentâ€™s **Physical Defense** â€œwith skillful hands.â€
- **Effect:** You can start to steal other peopleâ€™s identity, destiny, self-knowledge, and related aspects, using one of the following options as appropriate:

#### Steal Identity

- **Effect:** You steal the targetâ€™s identity, making others think that you are the target.
- **Duration:** 2 hours.
- **Detection:**  
  - The same observer can pass an **Intuition (INT)** appraisal (**Difficulty Value** 15) to detect the sense of disobedience.  
  - An observer who is one **Sequence** lower than you can pass an **Intuition (INT)** appraisal (**Difficulty Value** 20) to perceive the sense of incongruity.

#### Steal Cognition

- **Effect:** You steal the targetâ€™s self-cognition, making the target temporarily unaware of who they are.
- **Notes:** The effect is similar to stealing ideas. [[Stealing Ideas]]

#### Stealing Extraordinary Characteristics

- **Effect:** You can steal the targetâ€™s **Extraordinary Characteristics**.
- **Target requirements:** The target must be either:
  - voluntary, **or**
  - in a helpless state (and one **Sequence** lower than you).

#### Grafting Fate

- **Effect:** This is also a kind of stealing. You change the opponentâ€™s fate to yours, and yours to theirs.
- **Duration:** 1 round.
- **Exchange of special effects:**  
  - During the grafting, the special effects you have on the opponent take effect on the opponent, and the opponentâ€™s special effects take effect on you.  
  - Special effects that were applied before the grafting will be transferred back if the round ends, but will be borne by the grafted person during the grafting process.  
  - If someone applies a strengthening or negative special effect to you during this process, then after the grafting is over, it will stay on the body of the grafted person.
- **Attacks:**  
  - An attack on you is regarded as an attack on the opponent.  
  - An attack on the opponent is regarded as an attack on you.
- **Clarification on â€œessenceâ€ of effects:**  
  - One case: the essence of a special effect is still on you, but you pass on the effect after it takes effect to others; therefore it is passed back after the grafting ends.  
  - Another case: a special effect applied to you in the middle of the grafting is regarded as applied to the transferred person; the essence is on the transferred person, so after the grafting ends, it still remains on the transferred person.
- **Note:** Effects on targets with Sequence higher than yours can only be transferred in half.
- [[Special Effects]]

#### Steal Fate

- **Target requirements:** You choose a voluntary or helpless target and steal the otherâ€™s fate.
- **Permanence:** After stealing the fate, you never need to return it.
- **Ongoing consequence:** From now on, all the good and bad that will happen to the targetâ€™s fate in the future will be transferred to you.
- **Replacement effect:** You can completely replace the targetâ€”everything will think you are the target.
  - Parents, relatives, lovers, and friends will think you are the target, even though your appearance has not changed at all.
- **Effect on the stolen person:** The target becomes unable to have any communication with reality and has literally lost their destiny:
  - No one will notice them.
  - No matter what actions they take, no one will notice.
  - In the end, they can only die little by little in a corner, and may even turn into a corpse without anyone noticing.
- **Who can perceive the incongruity:** Only beings of the same high level can perceive the incongruity of fate, perceive something wrong, or perceive the truth.
- **Typical requirement:** Because the subject of a stolen fate must be voluntary or helpless, stealing fate usually requires a â€œworm of separation time.â€ It can only take effect by parasitizing the target into a state of default helplessness for you. Stealing authentication in this way succeeds by default.
- **Lower-level targets:** If the target is lower than two of you (two **Sequence** levels lower than you), you do not need to do the above; you can directly steal the opponentâ€™s fate.

- [[Parasitism]]
- [[Clone]]
- [[Avatar]]

##### Clarification: Stealing Fate vs. Clones (Mechanical Notes)

- Stealing fate and turning others into clones are not the same:
  - Stealing a personâ€™s fate does not turn them into a doppelgÃ¤nger; it turns them into an unlucky person who still exists, but no one notices what they do.
  - Whatever you do can be regarded as them, and whatever you do will be regarded as them.
- These abilities are often used together, which can create the misunderstanding of â€œstealing fate = creating avatar.â€
- Creating a clone is creating a clone; stealing a fate is stealing a fate.
  - If you turn a person into a clone, that is still â€œparasiticâ€: their fate is still in their body and has not been transferred to your body. This is the difference.
- Practical warning: stealing fate means the fate will belong to you whether good or bad in the future; stealing fate is not necessarily a good thing. It is more realistic to create a clone to â€œtake overâ€ fate.  
  > **GM Note:** This paragraph contains guidance on risk/choice; mechanics above still apply exactly as written.
- If you make the parasite into a clone:
  - The cloneâ€™s ability depends on itself, but it can use your ability to a certain extent, which usually can only reach the level within **Sequence** 5.
  - If you want to use your body to use high-level abilities:
    - It requires a Full-Round Action to prepare.
    - Passive abilities cannot be used.
    - All abilities can only be used initially.
- **Note:** The number of clones you can create is proportional to the extra extraordinary characteristics of the wrong path you devour; that is, the number of extraordinary stacked skills represents the number of weak clones you have.
- If you have the wrong extraordinary characteristic corresponding to a high **Sequence** level, then you can give it to raise that Worm of Time clone to the corresponding level.

### Detached Worm of Time

```




- **Cost:** 1 point of **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** A Full-Round Action.
- **Effect:** You detach a Worm of Time, which parasitizes targets through shadows that are hard to see.
  - You separate a Worm of Time and let it imperceptibly reach the targetâ€™s side, and immediately perform a parasite instead of you.
  - When the Full-Round Action is over, the Worm of Time is considered to have arrived at the targetâ€™s side.
  - At that time, conduct a skill test against the targetâ€™s **Willpower Defense**; on success, it is considered to have entered a shallow parasitic state.
- > **GM Note:** The Full-Round Action implies you may want to talk to delay time and divert the opponentâ€™s attention so they do not become aware of your action.

#### Targets at the Same Level or One Level Lower

- This is usually difficult for targets at the same level as you or only one level lower.
- If the parasitic object is a demigod:
  - They can perform an **Intuition (INT)** identification (**Difficulty Value** 15) to detect mistakes in time.
  - They have one action or two free actions of time to resist, but the impact must be avoided by immediately killing the Worm of Time by any means or performing a transcendent ability to move.
    - Killing the Worm of Time: an indiscriminate range attack or an attack that can accurately lock the Worm of Time.
    - Moving: a swap with a secret puppet or a flame jump.
  - If the evasion fails, they are immediately treated as a shallow parasite.
  - You can allow the Worm of Time to lurk within them, or you can instantly transform into a deep parasite as a free action.

- [[Deep Parasite]]
- [[Secret Puppet]]
- [[Flame Jump]]
- [[Demigod]]

#### Diversion Effects (to Avoid Awareness)

- You can use verbal confrontation to divert the opponentâ€™s attention; once successful, it can have the following effects:
  - Once successful, let them believe you are a good person and will not cause malicious thinking misleading to them: **Intuition (INT)** identification difficulty +5.  
    (This needs to be based on the difficulty of misleading thinking based on the specific situation. Based on your concealment, an extraordinary who is about to lose control is usually easy to believe you.)
  - A successful social identification: **Intuition (INT)** identification difficulty +5.  
    (False social skills are usually very persuasive, but the essence here is that you are trying to convince others that you are harmless, or to distract others, which can be in the form of very interesting intelligence.)
  - If the opponent is the Fool, Spectator, Reader, Secret Peer, and Destiny Path: **Intuition (INT)** identification difficulty -5.  
    (This type of approach usually has high inspiration, can quickly detect something is wrong, or can quickly discover the power of the mysterious field.)
  - If the opponentâ€™s remaining spiritual value is 10 or below, and they are weak and helpless: the **Intuition (INT)** test fails by default and parasitism is basically guaranteed to succeed. Only the same level has a chance to resist with free actions.

#### Targets Two Levels Lower

- The above content is limited to targets who are at the same level as you or only one level lower than you.
- You usually do not need to bother with targets who are two levels lower than you; after a Full-Round Action, you can parasitize them directly (unless you have enough vigilance).

#### Deep Parasite Outcome

- A deeply parasitized target still has their own consciousness and can see, hear, and feel, but the body already belongs to you completely.
- The target is like a toy that can only be manipulated by you.
- You can always monitor their thoughts:
  - Their thoughts can only stay at the superficial level and cannot directly dig out secrets.
  - It is equivalent to mind reading all the time.
- A Deep Parasite target is helpless to you by default, and you can steal their fate at any time.

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.

```




- **Cost:** 3 spiritual points.
- **Use:** A Casting Action; once per round.
- **Effect:** You can make the targetâ€™s fate go wrong for a certain period of time, achieving one of the following results:
  1. Let the results of divination and prophecy be wrong. For divinations and prophecies one level below you, you can even completely customize what goes wrong.
  2. Transfer your consciousness and let an avatar become your main body. To do this, you must first create an avatar that is no more than one **Sequence** level with you, and then let the avatar steal the fate, identity, and self-cognition of that person before you can do it.
  3. Make a target and an area lose contact with the outside world, so that no one can detect changes in them and the environment, unless it is other angels of the same **Sequence** level as you. (This ability can also be used on yourself to achieve a similar psychological invisibility effect.)
  4. Make mistakes in the trajectory of fate and the arrangement of the reservation. For example, the writer of **Sequence** 1 arranged for a person to be attacked on the third day; you can turn it into the second day, but you cannot just leave it alone unless you intervene, and the change is reasonable enough.
- Other effects based on the principle of fate error and allowed by **GM**.

> **GM Note:** The RAW also states that the scope of â€œstealingâ€ expands to include destiny, identity, self-knowledge, and extraordinary characteristics, and describes grafting and replacement as related expressions of the same principle. Use this as framing; the specific mechanical options above are the concrete implementations.

text: 'Use: Expend a Casting Action; choose a target. Effect (check): Pass a Library
  or Intuition (INT) check of Difficulty Value (30 - the targetaTMs sequence level).

```




- **Use:** Expend a Casting Action; choose a target.
- **Effect (check):** Pass a Library or **Intuition (INT)** check of **Difficulty Value** (30 - the targetâ€™s sequence level).
  - On success, you learn the general fate of the target and the general past:
    - You know what kind of education they went through.
    - You know what they went through roughly, but usually not in detail.
- **Limits (demigod-and-above involvement):**
  - If the fate involves things above demigods, you can only feel â€œabnormalâ€ at most for those contents.
  - If a demigod is right in front of you, you can gain insight into their general experience and education as above, but things above other demigods will still be covered up unless you get more clues.
- **Repeat use:** Reusing the skill will usually give the same result unless you acquire new material.
- **Using new information:** When you get new information, you can directly rearrange your previous clues, conduct another appraisal on the spot you want to gain insight into, and try to see the truth clearly. You do not have to go find the target you used this ability on before.
- **Clue bonus:** Every thing that can be used as a clue can give you +2 identification.
- **Misleading risk:** If the other party can have a certain influence on fate, you may also be misled.
- **Extra appraisal:** Conduct a 20-**Difficulty Value** **Intuition (INT)** appraisal to judge whether this thing is related to you, and how it is related; you need to find further clues. Repeating the appraisal will still only get the same result until you get new clues.
- **Detecting specific states (without full attribution):**
  - You can discover that a target is a Secret Puppet, but you cannot directly know who the Secret Puppetâ€™s owner is.
  - You can only see that they became a Secret Puppet at a certain moment.
  - You can find that a person influenced by the audienceâ€™s psychology has had their destiny shift, but you cannot find hidden parasites.
- **Detecting parasitism by level:**
  - For a target parasitized by a person lower than you, you can detect â€œsomething is wrong.â€
  - For a parasitic target of an angel person, even if you are the king of angels, you cannot see it and cannot detect â€œsomething is wrong,â€ unless some evidence of their being parasitized is found directly; then identification can be carried out.

- [[King of Angels]]

- **Effect:** Insight of Destiny resolves using its yaml ability block and section prose.
- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
