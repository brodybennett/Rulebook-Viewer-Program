# Sequence 1: The Worm of Time

- See also: [[Pathway]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Let the development of at least one city move forward or backward by an era within three months, or stagnate for a hundred years without any change.

> **GM Note:** The RAW labels this as an “unofficial ceremony.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +1, **Dexterity** +1; your deceit and skill level up by one skill level. [[UNCLEAR: “deceit and skill” is ambiguous—this may mean two specific skills, or “deceit” plus skills generally.]]

### Time Authority

- **Cost:** 5 **spirituality points**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** 1 **casting action**. [[Casting Action]]
- **Limits:** Twice per **encounter**. [[Encounter]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose a **scene** or a single **target**. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW also says “can be used only for one target” while allowing scene-based use; it is unclear how these statements reconcile.]]

> **Lore:** An ancient mottled huge phantom forms behind you, like a stone-carved wall clock face divided into twelve grids (gray/black, alternating, each with different symbols). An indescribable invisible torrent emerges, as if traveling through a long history.

Choose one of the following effects when you use **Time Authority**:

- **Time Acceleration:**
  - The pointer moves forward rapidly, and time acceleration appears in the largest city within the range you specify; the specific state time will be advanced according to your spiritual consumption, as if you have experienced the erosion of time.
  - During combat, the time state of the designated target is considered to have passed 5 rounds, approximately equal to one encounter.
  - This is only a reference: as long as the special effects on the designated target have a duration, then these special effects will usually be cleared when the effective time expires, unless these effects can last for a year.
  - **Extra:** If there is an **Extraordinary** with **Sequence** 3 or below [[Sequence]] and a remaining lifespan of less than 300 years on the field, he will immediately turn into a hunchbacked white-haired old man. If he has no ability to counteract in this state, he will become a Truly becoming an old man; this is a permanent effect. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW phrasing “become a Truly becoming an old man” is unclear; it appears to indicate a permanent transformation if not counteracted.]]

- **Time Stagnation:**
  - The pointer gradually stagnates here.
  - Until your next round of action, the target you selected or the affected object of the entire scene cannot take action; this does not include you.
  - You get an additional casting action on the basis of consuming one casting action; that is, this action does not count. [[UNCLEAR: “this action does not count” is unclear—whether it refunds the casting action immediately, or only negates the action cost for the round.]]

- **Reversal of Time:**
  - The pointer rotates counterclockwise quickly, and everyone’s state changes back to five rounds ago, which is roughly equivalent to an encounter.
  - Also for reference, this ability is the reverse of time acceleration, and the effect of time acceleration can be restored through this ability. [[UNCLEAR: “restored” is ambiguous—this may mean “reversed/undone,” but the exact interaction is not precisely stated.]]

### Stealing

- **Effect:** If you become the **King of Angels** [[King of Angels]] (multiple copies of **Sequence** 1 characteristics [[Sequence 1 characteristics]] or accommodate **uniqueness** [[uniqueness]]), then your stealing can try to steal the authority of **Sequence** 0 [[Sequence 0]] for a short time.
- Even if you’re not, you can already steal other people’s time, and steal other people’s **anchors** [[anchors]] on a large scale.
  - The latter requires you to steal in a concentration place of believers. [[concentration place of believers]]
