text: 'Cost: 5 spirituality points. [[Spirituality]] Use: 1 Casting Action. Casting
  Action Limits: Twice per encounter. Encounter Targeting and range: Choose a scene
  or a single target, depending on the chosen effect. Choose one of the following
  effects when you use Time Authority: Time Acceleration: The pointer moves forward
  rapidly, and time acceleration appears in the largest city within the range you
  specify; the specific state time will be advanced according to your spiritual consumption,
  as if you have experienced the erosion of time. During combat, the time state of

- **Cost:** 5 **spirituality points**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**. Casting Action
- **Limits:** Twice per **encounter**. Encounter
- **Targeting and range:** Choose a **scene** or a single **target**, depending on the chosen effect.

> **Lore:** An ancient mottled huge phantom forms behind you, like a stone-carved wall clock face divided into twelve grids (gray/black, alternating, each with different symbols). An indescribable invisible torrent emerges, as if traveling through a long history.

Choose one of the following effects when you use **Time Authority**:

- **Time Acceleration:**
  - The pointer moves forward rapidly, and time acceleration appears in the largest city within the range you specify; the specific state time will be advanced according to your spiritual consumption, as if you have experienced the erosion of time.
  - During combat, the time state of the designated target is considered to have passed 5 rounds, approximately equal to one encounter.
  - This is only a reference: as long as the special effects on the designated target have a duration, then these special effects will usually be cleared when the effective time expires, unless these effects can last for a year.
  - **Extra:** If there is an **Extraordinary** with **Sequence** 3 or below Sequence and a remaining lifespan of less than 300 years on the field, he will immediately turn into a hunchbacked white-haired old man. If he has no ability to counteract in this state, he becomes a white-haired old man until counteracted.

- **Time Stagnation:**
  - The pointer gradually stagnates here.
  - Until your next round of action, the target you selected or the affected object of the entire scene cannot take action; this does not include you.
  - You get an additional Casting Action without spending the original one; the original action is not spent.

- **Reversal of Time:**
  - The pointer rotates counterclockwise quickly, and everyone’s state changes back to five rounds ago, which is roughly equivalent to an encounter.
  - Also for reference, this ability is the reverse of time acceleration; the **GM** decides how time acceleration effects are restored through this ability.

- **Effect:** Time Authority resolves using its yaml ability block and section prose.
