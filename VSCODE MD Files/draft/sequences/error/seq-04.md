- **GM permission:** Stealing allowed by other GMs.

#### Sequence 2 Note (Stealing Concepts)

- **Sequence 2:** You can steal concepts such as a country-wide three-wheeled day, or a full moon, but not night itself, because day is essentially night illuminated by the sun, and the world is inherently dark, only illuminated by the sun. There is light only when the sun illuminates. The day is stolen because light is superimposed on darkness, and if darkness is stolen, there may be nothing.

- **Effect:** **Steal Storage** lets you always keep the things you have stolen and let them appear at the right time, including the ideas you have stolen. You can store up to a number of intangible substances equal to your Sequence level, as well as extraordinary abilities, extraordinary effects, thoughts, memories, and destiny.

- **Releasing and gifting:**

  - Gifting it to another is a spellcasting action; make an Intuition (INT) check vs Willpower Defense unless the other party consents.
  - The person to be gifted does not have to be the original owner.
  - Extraordinary abilities are usually only allowed to be gifted (returned) to the original owner, or released and used by yourself.
  - If the original owner has already lost the qualification to use this ability, then they can only use it for two hours at most.  
    [[Qualification to use an ability]]

#### Detailed Instructions for Steal Storage

- Examples of matter are the mystical sun and light, which are intangible products that you cannot carry with you.
- When using supernatural powers, it is equivalent to the usable time you have stolen before, and cannot be recycled after release, because you cannot steal your own extraordinary ability.
- After the idea is returned, because it has already started to execute, it will also lose its timeliness.
- If you use your clone to steal a transcendent ability you unleash, the ability you gain is also diminished to ten minutes of use, lasts until the next encounter, and then only for one turn.  
  [[Clone]]
- These things share your inspiration cap for storage, and thoughts and ideas also occupy that cap, and you can release them whenever you see fit.  
  Intuition cap
- You cannot store items with entities, and items with entities still need to be kept by you or obtained additionally.

- When your storage slot is full and you continue to steal, you can choose stored items to replace and release unnecessary items.
- You can also directly discard unnecessary abilities and ideas, which is essentially a kind of release, but the return of ideas or abilities to non-original owners will be directly regarded as invalid actions: they are released, but nothing happens.
- Thoughts can be released directly in your mind and read silently, and then you don't act on it.

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.

  spirit body, and even the thread of the spirit body is also hidden. #### Levels
  of Parasitism Preliminary Parasitism: Use the host to hide yourself, prolong your
  life, and recover from injuries. You can see everything the host sees and hear all
  the sounds the host hears. In preliminary parasitism, you can share the host''s
  senses but cannot read or steal thoughts; thought-reading requires Deep Parasitism.'
```





- **Definition:** **Parasitism** is a kind of stealing; what you steal is life.
- **Use:** A [[Full-Round Action]] to parasitize into a person's body or a plant's body.
- **Effect on your body:** Your body becomes invisible, overlapping with the host's spirit body, and even the thread of the spirit body is also hidden.

#### Levels of Parasitism

- **Preliminary Parasitism:**
  - Use the host to hide yourself, prolong your life, and recover from injuries.
  - You can see everything the host sees and hear all the sounds the host hears.
  - In preliminary parasitism, you can share the host's senses but cannot read or steal thoughts; thought-reading requires **Deep Parasitism**.
- **Deep Parasitism:**
  - More comprehensive control, almost fused with the host's spirit body.
  - Directly monitor the host's thoughts, understand their intentions, and actively take over the body.
  - The host is no longer in control except for their own thoughts.

#### Switching Between Levels

- Using a Full-Round Action, you can switch from preliminary parasitism to deep parasitism.
- **Sequence 3:** Only a spellcasting action is required.
- **Sequence 2:** A free action.

#### Limitations and Guidance

- > **GM Note:** Do not substitute the parasite of Sequence 4 into Amon's parasite at will. At the level of Sequence 4, the thief has not yet created the power to create countless clones at will, which needs to be done at the angel level. Therefore, this parasitism is to make your body virtual, become a spirit body, enter a person's body, and overlap with their soul-so you can only parasitize one.  
  [[Amon]]  
  [[Angel]]  
  Error pathway
- > **GM Note:** If you parasitize animals and plants for a long time, it will cause your cognition to be confused (you can't tell who you are), you will gradually forget your own positioning, and maybe because there is no one to communicate with, you gradually go crazy-on the verge of losing control, and gradually overwhelmed by these crazy tendencies.
- **Sequence 2:** You can parasitize microorganisms in the air.

#### Detection and Divination

- When you successfully parasitize, you and the host's spirit body are regarded as one.
- Even [[id:alias-divination|Divination]] can't directly know where you are and who you are parasitizing. There is a problem, but it is very difficult to find this person in the vast crowd, and people who are not as good as you usually can't divine any information.
- This usually only parasitizes weaker targets than you, because the same level of parasitism is very easy to cause others to notice.
  - A demigod can usually find that you are parasitizing them through a **Difficulty Value** 15 Intuition check (the shallow parasitism has not been completed at this time, just started the first step).
- But once the parasitism is complete, your own existence is extremely hidden and difficult to detect.
  - Even if the other party is an angel, and also an angel of the thief path, they cannot directly obtain your information through extraordinary abilities, unless you actively expose something.

#### Interaction and Removal

- > **GM Note:** In the face of the first type of "parasite," you can remind the host through dreams, subconscious dialogues, etc., without worrying about being discovered, because the parasite must rely on the senses of the host to perceive things around it.
- > **GM Note:** In the second state, there is no way to bypass the parasite to talk to the host, but there is also a chance to clear it: an object of faith that relies on the host. When you let go of your heart and pray, the object of faith can find the existence of parasites and give feedback with the help of certain rituals to complete the separation or removal.
- > **GM Note:** The prerequisite is that the host itself does not know what will happen; otherwise the parasite must be alert and stop it.

- **Effect:** Parasitism resolves using its yaml ability block and section prose.
- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
