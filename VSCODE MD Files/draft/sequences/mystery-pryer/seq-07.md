# Sequence 7: Warlock

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Intuition (INT)** +2.
- Your occult/occult language can be quickly raised to proficiency.

### Speed Word

- **Use:** Once per turn, you can use **1 Casting Action** as **1 free action** (non-stackable).
- **Effect:** Your channeling is very fast.
- **Counteracting:** The ability cast by the high-speed oracle allows you to use it to counteract the abilities of others.
  - Example: If a storm-path water spell deals 2d10 damage, and a [[Red Priest]] fire ability deals 2d10 damage, you can reduce the damage by subtracting the Red Priest’s damage result from your damage result.
  - This does not mean fire abilities can only be counteracted with water; you can also split them with lightning.
- **Limits:** The high-speed divine words of the Mystic Pathway can only be used in the abilities of the Mystic Pathway itself.

### Knowledge Enhancement

- **Trigger:** When you cast a damage-type spell.
- **Cost:** If you expend an extra Casting Action, you can apply **Knowledge Enhancement** to that spell.
- **Effect:** You spend more time tuning the spell with occult knowledge to increase its damage output.
- **Limits:**
  - Generally, Knowledge Enhancement can strengthen one layer at most, and cannot be stacked infinitely.
  - Cumulative casting is more in line with high-level ritual magic.
  - Knowledge Enhancement is only an explanation of the spell cast and cannot be stolen or recorded.
  - Recording/stealing captures only the base ability; Knowledge Enhancement must be applied by the user. Scrolls can store enhanced effects.
  - [[Voyeur ability]]
  - [[Recorder]]
  - [[Scroll casting]]

### Spellcaster

You have learned to manipulate supernatural forces, and you gain the following spells.

- **Fireball**
  - **Cost:** Consumes **2 spirit points**, **1 Casting Action**.
  - **Use:** Choose a target.
  - **Effect:** Unleash a ball of fire that counters the target’s [[Physical Defense]] with [[Occultism]] and deals **1d10 fire damage**.
  - **Benefits of Knowledge Enhancement:** Spirit consumption +1; the number of fireballs changes from one to (**Intuition (INT)/2**, rounded up); you can attack multiple targets, but each target can only be hit once.

- **Frost**
  - **Cost:** Consumes **3 Spirit points**, **1 Casting Action**.
  - **Use:** Choose a target within your **field of vision**.
  - **Effect:** Cause a burst of cold air around the target, using [[Occultism]] to counter the target’s [[Physical Defense]], dealing **1d10 cold damage**. Inorganic objects will be frozen, and the physical and fire damage received is halved.
  - **Aftereffects:**
    - A creature that takes cold damage has half its movement on its next move.
    - The creature takes a -2 penalty on its next check.
    - Negate the effect on targets with [[Cold Resistance]].
  - **Benefits of Knowledge Enhancement:** spirituality consumption +3; Frost changes to ice storm:
    - Choose an area with a radius of **10 meters**.
    - The area bursts into snow and becomes extremely cold.
    - [[Mysticism]] resists the [[Physical Defense]] of all creatures in the area, causing **3d6 cold damage**.
    - The area is immediately recognized as an **extremely cold environment**.
    - **Extremely cold environment:** Creatures without cold resistance suffer:
      - Continuous -2 disadvantage in skill and attribute checks.
      - A total of -2 in
