- **Effect:** You spy on the secret of future destiny. This effect can accurately see part of the picture clearly and accurately.
- **Use:** You can make an **Intuition (INT)** check to determine what the outcome of an action will be.
- **Difficulty:**
  - **Difficulty 15:** At least one yes-or-no answer must be obtained.
  - **Difficulty 20:** Obtain a picture. The picture is relatively general, and the clues are only a small part of the picture.
  - **Difficulty 25:** The picture you get is clearer and more intuitive.
  - **Difficulty 30:** Foretell the people or things you should contact next—who will be helpful to you.
- **Outcome Modifiers:**
  - **Big Success:** You figure out how to act in your best interest.
  - **Big Failure:** You accidentally see something you shouldn’t.
- **Limits:** This ability does not only reveal symbolic meanings; it can also reveal accurate and clear partial pictures. This prophecy is extremely strong, and it can even predict some matters related to [[Uniqueness]] and the [[King of Angels]].
- **Aftereffects:** Trying to predict something higher than oneself may bring a certain amount of [[Backlash]] whether it fails or not. If there are too many predictions at one time, the **GM** should warn of [[Temporary Madness]] according to the situation.

> **GM Note:** This prophecy can reveal accurate and clear partial pictures and may touch on very high-level matters (including Uniqueness and the King of Angels). The **GM** should control what information is given to the user of Prophecy—what can be predicted and what cannot—and should be careful not to allow predictions of things that should not be seen.
