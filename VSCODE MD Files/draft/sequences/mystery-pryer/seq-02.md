You transform yourself into a creature made purely of information. An out-of-control Sage will become an informational existence called “Knowledge Goblin”.

- **Cost:** 3 points of spirituality.
- **Use:** **Free Action**.
- **Effect:** Enter **Informatization** state (a pure information-flow creature).

While in **Informatization**:
- You can directly informatize part of your own body so that pollution from other places besides you loses its carrier and directly evaporates/disappears, or is annihilated.
- You can see all knowledge around you; see an opponent’s **Sequence**/**Pathway** and all weaknesses; and see the layers of information contained around you. This is treated as the default opening of the effect of [[Eye of Mystery]].
- You can directly pass through walls and move at high speed through the torrent of information.
- A [[Voyeur]] or a [[White Tower]] who is not at the same level as you cannot see your existence.

Detection/visibility notes:
- For detection of invisible creatures by observation, refer to [[Invisibility]] in the [[Special Status]], and the advanced invisibility of Alien Pathway Sequence 5.
- **Beyonders** without demigod abilities cannot detect your existence through simple observation.
- Only **Beyonders** with the Mystic Path and Reader Path can try to detect you through detection and the rules of invisible creatures—and only if they encountered a clear threat and realized there were invisible creatures.

- **At Sequence 1:** You no longer have to become an information creature to use abilities that normally require Informatization (e.g., **Information Storm** and **Tampering**).

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.

  the targets Willpower Defense. The information content is customized. On hit: The
