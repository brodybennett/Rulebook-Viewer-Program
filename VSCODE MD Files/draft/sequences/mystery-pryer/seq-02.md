# Sequence 2: Sage

## Sage

You can virtualize your body, decomposing it into strands of complicated knowledge and becoming a pure information-flow creature.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Preventing a disaster involving higher powers.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +2, Education +2; choose two skills to upgrade by two levels.

### Knowledge Goblin

You transform yourself into a creature made purely of information. An out-of-control Sage will become an informational existence called “Knowledge Goblin”.

- **Cost:** 3 points of spirituality.
- **Use:** **Free Action**.
- **Effect:** Enter **Informatization** state (a pure information-flow creature).

While in **Informatization**:
- You can directly informatize part of your own body so that pollution from other places besides you loses its carrier and directly evaporates/disappears, or is annihilated.
- You can see all knowledge around you; see an opponent’s **Sequence**/**Pathway** and all weaknesses; and see the layers of information contained around you. This is treated as the default opening of the effect of [[LINK LATER: Eye of Mystery | type=mechanic | hint=referenced as “default opening” during informatization]].
- You can directly pass through walls and move at high speed through the torrent of information.
- A [[LINK LATER: Voyeur | type=sequence | hint=entity/type that might perceive hidden things]] or a [[LINK LATER: Reader | type=sequence | hint=entity/type that might perceive hidden things]] who is not at the same level as you cannot see your existence.

Detection/visibility notes:
- For detection of invisible creatures by observation, refer to [[LINK LATER: Invisibility | type=mechanic | hint=rules for observing/detecting invisible creatures]] in the [[LINK LATER: Special Status | type=chapter | hint=chapter referenced for invisibility rules]], and the advanced invisibility of [[LINK LATER: Alien Pathway Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=advanced invisibility referenced]].
- **Beyonders** without demigod abilities cannot detect your existence through simple observation.
- Only **Beyonders** with the [[LINK LATER: Mystic Path | type=pathway | hint=Pathway capable of detection]] and [[LINK LATER: Reader Path | type=pathway | hint=Pathway capable of detection]] can try to detect you through detection and the rules of invisible creatures—and only if they encountered a clear threat and realized there were invisible creatures.

- **At Sequence 1:** You no longer have to become an information creature to use the corresponding ability. [[UNCLEAR: RAW does not specify which “corresponding ability” this refers to.]]

### Information Storm

Complex and illusory symbols condense in your eyes one after another, pouring a lot of complicated and useless knowledge into the target’s mind, bursting its head.

- **Prerequisite:** While in **Informatization** (Knowledge Goblin).
- **Cost:** 3 spiritual points.
- **Use:** **Free Action**; once in a round.
- **Effect:** Make a [[LINK LATER: Knowledge Skill | type=mechanic | hint=skill check used by Information Storm]] check against the target’s [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense used against Knowledge Skill]]. The information content is customized.
- **On hit:** The target suffers a [[LINK LATER: Sanity Check | type=mechanic | hint=1d5/1d6+1 sanity check]] of **1d5/1d6+1**, and for this round is treated as being in a [[LINK LATER: Special Stunned State | type=condition | hint=can only take free actions this round]]; the target can only take free actions this round.

### Tampering

You affect the dissemination of any information, directly shielding the will and orders transmitted by the [[LINK LATER: Marionette | type=mechanic | hint=puppet-like control]] through the [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Body Thread | type=mechanic | hint=thread used for control]] within **Line of Sight**, or tampering with other commands that conform to your will.

- **Prerequisite:** While in **Informatization** (Knowledge Goblin).
- **Targeting and range:** Within **Line of Sight**.
- **Effect/Resolution:** This requires a [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=mechanic | hint=check used to oppose control effects]] to fight against the marionette master “My” will defense. [[UNCLEAR: RAW reads “marionette master My will defense”; the intended defender/possessor of the Will Defense is unclear.]]
- Also affects other secret puppet-like effects or effects of manipulating animals and dependents.
