# Hermit Pathway: Sequence 5

## Mysticologist

- **Pathway:** [[Hermit]]
- **Sequence:** 5

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Fabricate a set of false but rigorous and logical astronomical knowledge. The knowledge needs to involve at least nine stars, and be able to use this knowledge to perform effective astrology. Take the potion at the moment when it is repeatedly confirmed to be effective. (Unofficial ceremony.)

> **GM Note:** This ritual is framed as “exploring the unknown with blindfolded eyes.” It emphasizes using a logically consistent but false “theoretical starry sky” (with verification through astrology) to avoid direct influence from the real starry sky, and to prevent overload/instability from excessive cosmic knowledge.
