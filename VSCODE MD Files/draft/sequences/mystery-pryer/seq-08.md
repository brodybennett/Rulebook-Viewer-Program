### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +2, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
- **Skill growth:** Your fighting-related / dodge / throwing skills are included in the “rapid growth category” of your [[Sequence 9]], up to **Proficient**.

Additionally, you gain the following benefits:

1. **Special action identification bonus:** Your critical strike / double strike / proximity shooting and other special action identification +2 is beneficial, excluding first aid / surprise attack, and does not affect special actions that simply gain benefits, such as gaining momentum and aiming will not change from +2 to +2 4. It only affects identification.  
   [[UNCLEAR: The phrase “will not change from +2 to +2 4” appears corrupted; intended modifier text cannot be resolved safely.]]
