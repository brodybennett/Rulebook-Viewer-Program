# Hermit Pathway: Sequence 9

## Mystery Pryer

> **Lore:** Knowledge leaning toward the mystical. The mythical creature appears as a black mass with eyes, corresponding to the Tarot card “Hermit”.

You have a comprehensive but preliminary understanding and mastery of mysterious knowledge (e.g., magic, witchcraft, astrology). You know many ritual magics, but you may easily perceive existences hidden behind things—be careful, and remain in awe of extraordinary power.

- **Code of Play:** Do whatever you want, but do no harm.

## Advancement

### Learning and Qualification

1. Every time you receive **2 hours** of non-repetitive and effective guidance, you increase either **Mysticism** or **Mysticism Language** by **1 level** (choose one). Two trainings raise that skill to **Proficient**; fast-track learning caps at **Proficient**.
2. Learning quickly to become proficient does not prevent deeper study. See [[Skill Growth/Relationship]].
3. Potions only give you qualifications to learn and a channel to quickly understand; you can still study further.
4. When creating a character that has not just been promoted, you may **double** the Intuition (INT) points granted by the potion when spending them on occult-related growth skills.

## Extraordinary Abilities

You obtain more outstanding **Spiritual Vision** because of your inspiration.
- **Use:** 1 **free action** to activate.
- **Cost:** 1 **spirituality point per round** while active.
- **Effect:** While active, your vision gains the following benefits:


  1. **Etheric Body:** You can directly see a target’s health status through aura color, identify where their body is uncomfortable or has a problem, and (when it comes to a certain organ) you can see the inside through an unthickened door. You can confirm the number of people inside.
  2. **Spiritual Body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality. You cannot identify extraordinary people. You can also see through a door to view the inside, identify whether there is ritual magic power within, and you can penetrate the spiritual wall. [[Spiritual Wall]]
  3. **Mental Body:** You can see the color represented by another person’s emotions, but only in general content (e.g., whether they are depressed or uneasy). Negative emotions are usually a dark tone.
  4. **Astral Body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5. While in **Spiritual Vision**, your [[Spiritual Intuition Test]] gains **+2 beneficial**.

Additional rules and limitations:

- Dead creatures are usually only dull in color and cannot be identified.
- Spiritual materials usually have spirituality.
- The color of materials in **Spiritual Vision** usually represents its corresponding path. This does not mean you can see the power of a [[Beyonder]] Pathway.
- The colors seen by **Spiritual Vision** allow you to see each other in the dark, but you can only see the existence of colors; it is still possible to get lost in the dark because the colors you can see are limited.
- You cannot use these colors to distinguish undead biology.
- **Spiritual Vision** can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default if they have not dissipated for **24 hours**.
- **Spiritual Vision** cannot be recorded or stolen.

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.

**Curtain Peeping** lets you more easily perceive existences behind things. Be careful, and remain in awe of extraordinary power.

- **Trigger Conditions:**
  1. You are in an area involving the power of demigods and above, **or**
  2. There is an existence at least at the demigod level on the scene who is peeping here through extraordinary abilities.
- **Trigger Timing:** Once you resolve the first relevant Identification/Occult check in this area, you will notice them. If you are trying to interpret a book or thing involving demigod and above power, this effect is also triggered.

- **Outcome by result (Great success vs. Big failure):**
  1. **Great Success** Great Success: You saw something you shouldn’t have noticed, but fortunately it did not cause a sanity check. You only see some kind of power carrier of the other party, or part of the outline, or you feel the pressure of inspiration—someone is peeping here.  
     Great success only lets you unilaterally detect the other party. Unless you actively show any problems, you will not be noticed.
  2. **Big Failure** Big Failure: In addition to the above, you are aware of the other party, and the other party is also aware of you—you are exposed. This may cause that being to approach or remember you, and you may be bewitched step by step, falling into the abyss of depravity, and even going crazy or out of control on the spot.  
     “You must be careful and be in awe of extraordinary power.” Praying for the protection of the gods is the only way you can solve this matter.

- **Limitations:** Curtain Peeping is an interpretation of the **Mystery Pryer’s** spiritual intuition and therefore cannot be recorded or stolen.

- **Effect:** Curtain Peeping resolves using its yaml ability block and section prose.
- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.

You quickly cast a ritual spell.

- **Use:** As a [[Full-Round Action]], expend **1** [[Spellcasting Material]] to quickly perform a ritual spell.

**Spellcasting Materials** (concepts applied to higher Sequences):

- Your spellcasting ingredients are equal to **five times** your [[Reputation Rating]]. If your reputation is **Proficient** or higher, materials instead equal your reputation **level** (not rating x5).
- Replenishment:
  1. Whenever your materials are lost, you can go to the market to replenish these common materials.
  2. If you are an official Extraordinary, you can directly go to the official Extraordinary material inventory to replenish.
  3. If you are an official Extraordinary, then even if your reputation is not advanced enough, it will still be counted as advanced when calculating materials.  
     > **GM Note:** This is regarded as reimbursement to the official church. Without a valid application reason for private experiments or “shady” actions, you can only go to the market to buy according to your own credit.

- Compared to [[Apothecary]], your spellcasting materials do not include cockroach shells or weird/rare-but-useful things, so acquisition is not as demanding.
- You should care more about how many materials you can carry than how many you have.

Carrying capacity by clothing:

| Clothing | Spellcasting components you can carry (max) |
|---|---:|
| [[Ordinary Clothes]] | 4 |
| [[Performance Tuxedo]] | 8 |
| [[Spellcasting Wizard Robes]] | 12 |

You are proficient in the use of ritual magic.

1. As long as you have been trained in [[Occultism]] and know how to use ritual magic, even if you have not reached the advanced level, you can still perform it.
2. When you cast ritual magic, as long as your occultism is trained, your [[Occult Identification]] is successful by default. This only includes the occult identification when performing the ritual magic, and does not include subsequent occult identification when casting borrowed power.

- For the ritual magic you can cast, see [[Chapter Nine: Ritual Magic]] and [[Common Ritual Magic]].
- Ritual magic prepared in advance can make an enemy step into your trap, or perform anti-divination on the situation on the scene.
- Ritual magic is not only available to **Mystery Pryers** (who are better at it and can cast it quickly), but also to any Sequence that explicitly lists ritual abilities in its abilities section.

Difficulty outcomes:

  - Difficulty Value **15**: Get a very general result (e.g., finding objects only tells you a city).
  - Difficulty Value **20**: Get a more general result that usually gives a general direction.
- **Identification failure:** Repeated divination only gets the same result; you need to obtain new clues to divinate again.
