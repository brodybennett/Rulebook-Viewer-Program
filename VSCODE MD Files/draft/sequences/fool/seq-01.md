  [[Extraordinary Characteristic]]

### Advancement Ritual

- The larger the town, the more **Secret Puppets**, the more detailed the daily life, the more vivid and real the different destinies, and the longer the stretch, the better the effect of the ceremony.

> **GM Note:** The ritual’s intent is described as combining with **Spirit World** projections to regain one’s essence, prevent complete loss of self amid the washing of ideas/information/knowledge/symbols/signs, and harmonize with the **Spirit World** (“two in one”).

### Mysterious Realm

  [[Casting Action]]
- **Effect:** You create a prototype of the kingdom of God. The surrounding time and space are distorted, so that the area where the target is located is completely isolated from the outside world.
- Even information cannot be interacted with, and the perception of the audience through the collective subconscious sea will be invalid.  
  [[collective subconscious sea]]
- This can bring a certain amount of stealth effect, focusing on the hidden area.
- **Limits:** The largest range is a city.
