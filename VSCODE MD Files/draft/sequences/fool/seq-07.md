## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Inspiration** +1
- **Dexterity** +2
- Your **skillful hand** rises by 1 level.

Performance improvement:
- Every time you complete a well-prepared performance that conforms to the rules of magician impersonation, your **performance skill** increases by 1 level.
- From advanced → proficient, proficient → erudite, and erudite → master, it takes **2**, **3**, and **4** times to improve respectively.

### Injury Transfer

- **Use:** 1 **casting action**
- **Cost:** 2 **spirit points**
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 living creature whose wound your limb touched.
- **Effect:** You transfer the wound in the vital position to less important places such as the arm, turning the fatal injury into a minor injury.
  - [[Vital Strike]]

1. If the creature is under one type of vital strike effect, you can transfer the vital strike effect of this part to another limb part (e.g., transfer the vital strike effect of the head to the arm), and the shock and extra damage brought by the vital strike will be transferred remove.  
   - The creature suffers the vital blow effect of the arm, and the additional damage that is not originally included will also be reflected in the arm.
2. If the creature is dying, the fatal injury can be transferred to the non-fatal part; multiple fatal injuries can be transferred multiple times to terminate the dying.  
   - [[Dying]]
3. If you want to transfer the wound on the enemy’s arm to his head, fighting against physical defense, you will be able to do it successfully and cause corresponding additional damage, but this usually can only expose the other person’s skin and bones at most, unless the transfer is fatal hurt.  
   - [[Physical Defense]]
4. A creature’s wound can only be transferred on itself; the wound cannot be transferred from one person to another.

### Flame Jump

- **Use:** 1 **swift action**
- **Limits:** 1 time per round
- **Cost:** 3 **spirituality points**
- **Targeting and range:** Choose a fire or flame whose location you know, within 30 meters.
- **Effect:** The fire you left on yourself and the original flame flash, similar to teleportation, with the help of the special spirit world.

1. If there is an ignited flame within 30 meters, after casting, your body will be covered by flames, and the flame you selected will immediately rise to the size of a human figure, allowing you to jump out of it.
2. If there is fire (matches and other combustibles) within 30 meters, you need to use the fire to ignite it first before using this ability on it.
3. This ability can be used to avoid damage with the same priority as a free action, but does not include bullets, lights, lightning, or similar high-speed damage. You cannot dodge quickly during the flame jump, but you can cooperate with a paper doll double to complete the jump. For area damage, as long as the flame jump can jump out of the range, you will not suffer half the damage from the paper doll double.  
   [[UNCLEAR: The interaction between Flame Jump, the paper doll double, and “will not suffer half the damage” is self-contradictory in phrasing and cannot be resolved from RAW alone.]]
4. The flames you can jump include poisonous flames and black flames, and you will not be hurt by them only at the moment when your flames jump.

Special:
- When holding the ability of flame jump, you can sense flames that have ignited within 30 meters around you.

### Manipulate Flames

- **Use:** 1 **spell-casting action**
- **Cost:** 1 point of **spirituality**
- **Requirements:** You must snap your fingers or simulate the sound of snapping your fingers.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose a flame or kindling within 30 meters of a location you know (any combustibles including matches).
- **Limits:** You can only choose 1 usage at a time. The usage options are:

1. Choose one or more fire seeds. Whenever a creature reaches the location of the fire seeds, you can make it shoot up a pillar of fire, causing damage.
   - Each fire pillar causes **2d6** fire damage.
   - **Mysticism** against physical defense, ignoring agility and dodge.
   - This ignores high-speed dodge.
   - Each finger snap triggers 1 spark, up to 3 with no disadvantages; repeated bursts consume spirituality.
   > **GM Note:** Example from RAW: put matches in a straight line; as the enemy moves, trigger up to 3 matches in turn to produce 3 pillars of fire.
2. Choose a whole box of matches (at least 20 matches left in the box). The small space in the box lets you create a small explosion.
   - Use this box of matches as a kindling.
   - Causes **6d6** fire damage at a time.
   - Cannot trigger other uses.
3. Continuously add **1d6** fire damage to the weapon that draws paper as a soldier.
   - Consume **1 spirituality point** every round.
4. Control the fireballs and flames from the enemy to take effect: delay the explosion or slow the speed.
   - Make the final value of the corresponding identification **-4**.

Special:
- The magician can only control fire for a moment; you can’t shape fire for a long time, or create a wall of fire.
- After the potion is digested or promoted: you can start to summon flame out of thin air; no fire is needed, but it can only last for a moment unless there is a combustible object. It is too late to use this method to jump the flame.

### Air Bomb

- **Use:** 1 **casting action**
- **Cost:** 1 point of **spirituality**
- **Targeting and range:** Select 1 or more targets within the field of vision.
- **Requirements:** Need to snap fingers or simulate the sound of snapping fingers.
- **Check:** Inspiration + shooting against physical defense, ignoring the agility and dodge in physical defense.
- **Effect:** If the identification is successful, it causes **1d8** physical damage (comparable to a custom revolver).
- **Limits:** You can fire 3 times in a single casting action:
  - From the second shot: **-2** penalty
  - From the third shot: **-4** penalty

### Paper Doll Substitute

- **Use:** 1 **free action**
- **Cost:** 5 **spirituality points** and 1 **paper figurine**
- **Effect:** Choose one of the following effects to take effect:

1. Immediately before you are about to be attacked, you take the initiative to replace yourself with a paper doll, resisting an attack or other effects, completely nullifying the effect. You reappear at most **8 meters** away; the latter is incidental displacement effect.
   - Special (area attacks): If the double’s displacement doesn’t allow you to leave the area of influence, you take **half damage**. Half damage is rounded up.
   - Must be used immediately. Because it is an active ability, you must recognize the corresponding threat to be a substitute.
   - An effect that has already taken effect on you cannot be a substitute. Example: once the plague of the witch takes effect, the subsequent deterioration cannot be a substitute.
   - Note: The ability of free actions higher than 2 characters will be too late for the substitute.  
     [[UNCLEAR: “free actions higher than 2 characters” is not a defined timing unit and cannot be interpreted reliably from RAW alone.]]
2. You destroy a paper figurine with flames, etc., and choose 1 item of specific mystic information related to you (e.g., you plan to attack someone next). Realize anti-divination, and conduct a mystic appraisal as the difficulty of anti-divination.
   - When successful, this information will be excluded in related divination, spiritual intuition, prophecy, unless it exceeds the corresponding difficulty.
   - [[id:alias-anti-divination|Anti-Divination]]
3. You turn a paper figurine into an image that is exactly the same as you. In the eyes of others, it is another you, but closer to a wax figure that is completely the same but does not move. Hallucinations can bring it to life.
   - Creating hallucinations can last for **half an hour** in this usage.
   - Can fake the color of the aura, the ups and downs of the limbs, etc.
   - Cannot communicate.
   - Special: When the paper figurine turns into a dummy, your body can become invisible, but you cannot leave the dummy within **8 meters**.

### Illusion

- **Use:** 1 **casting action**
- **Cost:** 2 **spiritual points**
- **Targeting and range:** Affect the environment within **8 meters** around you.
- **Effect:** You influence your surroundings to create near-real illusions with colours, sounds, and smells; you create an illusion.

1. The content of the hallucination is customized; the created hallucination has color, sound, and smell at the same time, and is extremely real.
2. Any creature that witnesses the illusion must actively recognize that it may be an illusion and try to identify it before fighting.
3. Confrontation is a deception against detection/inspiration identification. Because this ability will generally be exposed after being used once, the subject deceived by the illusion will continue to have doubts about the illusion; creating illusions is usually only used once for the same person.

Special:
- Beings higher than 1-person default to directly perceiving hallucinations as false.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “higher than 1-person” is not defined (rank/Sequence/creature size/other), so the threshold cannot be stated more precisely.]]

### False "breathing underwater"

- **Use:** As a **casting action**
- **Cost:** 1 **sanity point**
- **Effect:** You create an invisible thin tube of air that is invisible, **5 meters** long.
  - You can breathe through its mouth and exhale through its nose, ensuring "underwater breathing" in an environment with a water depth of less than **5 meters**.
  - Or, in an environment with toxins and harmful gases, you can use it to breathe air up to **5 meters** above to avoid ingesting toxins, as long as the range of toxins does not exceed this length.

### Bone Softening

You soften your bones, freeing you from handcuffs, ropes, and boxes.

1. **Use:** 1 **casting action**. Whenever you fall into a grapple, or get restrained by handcuffs, ropes, and other small things, you can soften your bones and break free immediately.
   - This does not include oversize bondage where the xeno demigod lets your clothing bind yourself.
2. **Use:** 1 **casting action**. Whenever you realize that you are about to fall into a critical blow, even if you are in a state of physical restraint, you can soften your bones, barely bend your waist, and your upper body will fall backwards, avoiding this time vital blow.
   - Exclude the vital parts that you avoided, and perform an rd6: 1–5 is other vital points; 6 means the vital points are not hit.  
     [[UNCLEAR: “rd6” roll notation is not defined in RAW; the exact dice expression cannot be normalized safely.]]

### Turn Paper into Soldiers

You can turn paper into sharp objects, and also into sticks, bricks, and other weapons for a short time.

- **Use:** 1 **casting action**
- **Cost:** 1 point of **spirituality**
- **Requirements:** As long as you prepare paper corresponding to the approximate shape, you can make it sharp immediately after “shaking” and turn it into a weapon.

1. The effect of the manufactured weapon is equal to that in “Weapon Paradigm,” but you can only manufacture cold weapons, not complex hot weapons. The effect lasts **five minutes**, and can be used by others.  
   - [[Weapon Paradigm]]
2. Although it becomes sharper, it still does not get rid of the characteristics of paper. If a paper weapon hits a hard object such as armor, it will be damaged after being used **three times**.
3. Different weapons require different shapes of paper. Example: whips need long strips of paper; sticks need to roll the paper together first. You need to cut it in advance or use it according to the situation.

### Quick-casting technique

- **Limits:** Once per round
- **Use:** As a **free action**
- **Effect:** You can use any one of the spellcasting action abilities of:
  - Manipulate Flames
  - Air Bomb
  - Turn Paper into Soldiers
  - False "breathing underwater"
  - Bone Softening
  - Injury Transfer
- (This is a potion benefit that cannot be stolen or recorded.)

### Magician’s performance props

A prepared magician is completely different from an unprepared magician. Many abilities need corresponding materials prepared for consumption in advance. Excluding other items you usually carry, the number of props you can prepare is:

- Wearing normal clothes: **4 material slots** with 2–4 pockets.
- Wear a performance tuxedo: **8 material slots**, with 4–8 pockets, including hidden pockets.
- Wearing Spellcasting Wizard Robes: **12 material slots** with 8–12 pockets, including secret pockets.

The props do not need to be determined by your reputation because they are cheap. Slots occupied by different props:

1. Paper doll stand-in: every **3** paper doll stand-ins occupy **one** slot; you need to cut them out in advance.
2. Matchbox: each box of matches occupies **1** slot. There are **90** matches in a box, and every **30** matches is placed in a slot.
3. Drawing Paper into Soldiers: any kind of paper that can be turned into drawing paper into soldiers occupies **1** slot; you need to decide the shape in advance.

The rest of the props are determined by the GM according to their size. If you do not adjust the position of the props in advance before each battle, when a big failure occurs, you will be regarded as taking the wrong props (the substitute took out a match).

> **GM Note:** RAW guidance: if you want to play a magician, a performance tuxedo is the most appropriate option; wizard robes may affect the performance.
