# Fool Pathway: Sequence 9

## Seer

> **Lore:** The Fool Pathway’s mythical creature is described as an “embracing spirit worm,” corresponding to the Tarot card “The Fool.” Its Uniqueness evolves into a mythical creature.

- **Mythical Creature Form:** You transform into countless embracing spirit worms with crazy patterns on them.

> **Lore:** Compared with other Sequences, Seers lack means to control the enemy. Seers are more professional and knowledgeable in mysticism and divination, mastering methods such as astrology, card divination, pendulums, spiritual vision, spiritual numbers, and palm reading.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +2

- **Effect:** You gain the qualification and ability to better learn knowledge of the mysterious field.

- **Learning (Occultism):**
  1) Each time you receive effective, authentic, non-repetitive occult guidance lasting at least 2 hours, your **Occultism** increases by 1 level.
     - Required learning counts by level:
       - training → proficiency: 2
       - proficiency → advanced: 3
       - advanced → proficient: 4, up to mastery. [[UNCLEAR: The step “advanced → proficient” and the phrase “up to mastery” appear inconsistent; the destination level label for the 4-count step is unclear.]]
  2) Learning is limited to 1 time per day for knowledge digestion.
     - If you have mastered all divination skills listed under **Divination**, treat this as 1 learning immediately, and it is not counted in the number of times limited to 1 time per day.
  - **Special:** If you obtain a book of esoteric knowledge written by a **Beyonder** whose own esotericism has reached erudition and master, then this learning can be extended to the level of the author.
    - Erudite and master require 5 and 6 studies respectively, and generally require special channels to obtain.
  - When directly creating a character of a higher Sequence, the growth skill can be doubled by the inspiration brought by the potion to add growth skills. [[UNCLEAR: “growth skill can be doubled … to add growth skills” is unclear in how it applies during character creation and what exactly is doubled.]]

### Divination

- **Use:** 1 casting action
- **Cost:** 2 **Spirituality Points**
- **Effect:** Choose 1 divination method and conduct 1 **Occult Identification**.

- **Results by Difficulty Value:**
  - Difficulty Value 15: Get a very general result (e.g., finding objects only tells you a city).
  - Difficulty Value 20: Get a more general result, usually giving a general direction.
  - Difficulty Value 25: Obtain a fairly accurate result; finding objects is accurate to a certain street.
  - Difficulty Value 30: Obtain a very accurate result; divination reveals specific content.

- **Identification failure:**
  - Repeating the divination only yields the same result; you must obtain new clues to divine again.

- **Great success:**
  - The result is extremely accurate: the content is specific, and time, place, and people are also revealed.

- **Big failure:**
  - Based on the final value of the appraisal, you still obtain the corresponding content, but attract the attention of related beings.
  - If the content did not involve hidden beings, then directly or indirectly related **Beyonders** notice being watched.
  - Becoming aware of the gaze requires a **Spiritual Intuition** test, and the existence of higher than 1 person is detected by default regardless of difficulty. [[UNCLEAR: “higher than 1 person” is ambiguous (could mean higher level/Sequence than the diviner, or more than one entity/person).]]

- **Special:**
  - Before obtaining new clues, repeated divination in the same direction only yields the same result, regardless of difficulty.

- **Other divination factors:**
  1) Divination of things involving other people fails by default if there is no clue, and succeeds by default if there is their blood or belongings.
  2) For each clue obtained, divination of related events is +2 beneficial, but divination of targets higher than 1 character fails by default. [[UNCLEAR: “targets higher than 1 character” is ambiguous (could mean higher level/Sequence than the diviner, or multiple characters).]]
  3) The reason for detection and failure of the higher level is that under special circumstances, it is possible for the lower level to divine for the higher level.
  4) Whenever you are in deep sleep, you can perform an **Inspiration** appraisal with Difficulty Value 20.
     - If it succeeds, and something directly related to you has happened in the current period, you will see a general picture that needs to be interpreted. This is the first step of dream divination.
     - Example: If you are related to the god in charge of the moon, you will see a red moon; blood represents misfortune; tombstones represent the direct implication of certain events.

- **Divination methods you can choose (including but not limited to):**
  1) Tarot divination:
     - Silently read the content you want to divine.
     - You receive a relatively specific response in the form of 22 tarot cards in reverse, revealing the result of your divination content.
  2) Divination with coins:
     - Silently read the content you want to divine.
     - Toss a coin to get a simple yes/no answer.
  3) Astrology:
     - The divination target must provide basic information or blood.
     - Using an astrolabe or crystal ball, you can divine fate, general development, general trajectory of development, or current location.
     - The information obtained is relatively specific.
  4) Divination with a divination stick:
     - You need a stick, plus personal belongings or blood worn by the target for a long time.
     - Let it fall in one direction to point out the position you want to know.
  5) Pendulum divination:
     - You need a pendulum made of crystal or sterling silver.
     - You can only divine about things related or indirectly related to yourself.
     - Read or write down the content of the divination. It cannot be a question sentence; it must be a statement sentence.
     - You get a more specific yes/no answer.
     - The pendulum rotates clockwise or counterclockwise to give the result; the magnitude of rotation indicates specificity.
  6) Dream divination:
     - Write the content of divination on paper.
     - Use meditation to enter light sleep and directly see relevant pictures.

- **Limit (mastery of methods):**
  - The knowledge of divination is not mastered at the moment of becoming a **Beyonder**.
  - If you are a newly promoted Seer, you need relevant classics or a teacher to master these, and you can only master one type per day.

### Ritual Mastery
- **Effect:** While holding this ability, you gain access to ritual magic, regardless of whether your Occult skill is advanced or not.


- **Limits / Requirements:**
  - While you hold this ability, you are qualified to use ritual magic.
  - As long as you have at least been trained in **Occultism** and know how to use ritual magic, you can perform rituals regardless of whether your occult skills have reached advanced level.
  - For the ritual magic you can use, refer to [[Common Ritual Magic]].
  - This is the effect brought by 1 potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.

### Spiritual Vision
- **Use:** 1 **free action** to activate.
- **Cost:** 1 **spirituality point per round** while active.
- **Effect:** While active, your vision gains the following benefits:


  1) Etheric body:
     - You can directly see the health status of the target through the color of the aura.
     - You can directly find where the other party’s body is uncomfortable and where there is a problem.
     - When it comes to a certain organ, you can see the inside through the unthickened door and confirm the number of people inside.
  2) Spiritual body:
     - You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality.
     - You cannot identify **Beyonders**.
     - You can penetrate the door to see the inside.
     - You can identify whether there is ritual magic power in it.
     - You can penetrate the spiritual wall.
  3) Mental Body:
     - You can see the color represented by the other person's emotions, but only general content (e.g., whether the other person is depressed or uneasy).
     - Negative emotions are usually a dark tone.
  4) Astral body:
     - You cannot see the astral body.
  5) While in the state of **Spiritual Vision**, your **Spiritual Intuition** test is +2 beneficial.

- **Notes:**
  - Dead creatures are usually only dull in color and cannot be recognized.
  - Spiritual materials usually have spirituality.
  - The color of a material in **Spiritual Vision** usually represents its corresponding Pathway; this does not mean you can see the power of a **Beyonder**.
  - The color seen by **Spiritual Vision** allows you to see each other in the dark, but you can only see the existence of color; it is still possible to get lost in the dark.
  - Unlike dead creatures, undead creatures have deep black spirituality color instead of none.

- **Special:**
  - **Spiritual Vision** can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default; those that have not dissipated for 24 hours.
  - It cannot be recorded or stolen.
