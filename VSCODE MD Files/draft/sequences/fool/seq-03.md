# Sequence 3: Ancient Scholar

## Ancient Scholar

> **Lore:** Scholars from antiquity who study antiquity—witnessing fate, influencing the present, and never reversing the past.

### Help from History

You can seek help from history in two ways:

- **Borrow strength from your past self:** Each use lasts **5 minutes**.
- **Summon images from the pores of history:** You can summon images of **people** or **objects**.
  - The more detailed and true your understanding of the relevant history and subject, the greater the probability of success and the longer the duration.
  - When summoning people or objects whose **personality** is higher than your own, the projection manifests only part of the power and characteristics. [[UNCLEAR: “personality” is not defined as a stat/rank; unclear how to compare it.]]

Limits for images summoned from the pores of history:

- **Simultaneous limit:** You can maintain **up to 3** historical images at the same time, including those summoned by **marionettes** [[Marionette]].
- **Maximum duration:** A summoned image can last **up to 1/4 hour**.

### Paper Doll Substitute Additions

In addition to transferring diseases, wounds, curses, attacks, prophecies, and gazing, **paper doll substitute** [[paper doll substitute]] can also transfer a certain part of the paper doll to the target:

- The transferred part runs like a real one before it is found to be fake.

Additional parameters and related effects:

- **Initial control time:** 2 seconds.
- **Then:** transformed into a puppet for 10 seconds.
- **Control range:** 500 meters.
- **Marionette driven; position exchange limit:** 5 kilometers. [[position exchange]]
- **“Flame jump” distance:** 5 kilometers. [[flame jump]]
- There is a certain limit to the difference in body size.
- Simulated organs may be useful or just for display.
- Create fog and lower the temperature.

## Advancement

### Main Materials

- A pair of eyes of Fulgrim's dog (also known as the Guardian of Origin Castle) [[Fulgrim's dog]] [[Origin Castle]]
- A flocculated heart of the Mist Demon Wolf [[Mist Demon Wolf]]

### Auxiliary Materials

- 100 ml of Fulgrim's dog's blood [[Fulgrim's dog's blood]]
- 30 g of hoarfrost crystals from Mist Demon Wolf [[hoarfrost crystals]]
- A large number of real ancient historical records [[ancient historical records]]

### Advancement Ritual

- Completely divorced from reality for at least three hundred years.
- Take potions after you have become history and do not belong to the current era. [3] [[UNCLEAR: Reference “[3]” has no source here; unclear what it points to.]]

### Playing the Code

- Scholars from Antiquity and the Study of Antiquity
  1. From ancient times and research ancient times.
  2. Can research things from history.
  3. Witness fate, influence the present, and cannot reverse the past.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Inspiration** [[Inspiration]] +1
- **Education** [[Education]] +2
- **History skill** [[History skill]] increased by 1 skill level

### Summon Historical Images

- **Use:** Once per round; **swift action**.
- **Cost:** Consume 2 points of **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]].
- **Check:** Perform a **historical appraisal** [[historical appraisal]] with **Difficulty Value** [[Difficulty Value]] 20.
- **Effect (on success):** Summon up to 1 of the following from history:
  - Items you once owned, or
  - Humans you knew.

Additional usage modes and actions:

- **Fog of history:** You may enter the **fog of history** [[fog of history]] that you know and hide in a historical scene you once knew. In reality, it is difficult to find your body without similar means.
- **False existence via self-projection:** You can enter the **historical projection** [[historical projection]] of yourself that you summoned in the fog of history, make it your substitute in reality, become a “false” existence, and gain your consciousness.
- **Entering the fog of history:** **move action**.
- **Dismissing the historical projection:** **free action**.

Costs and difficulty adjustments (as stated):

- Summoning ordinary objects requires almost no consumption of Spirituality.
- If you want to summon extraordinary items, you need 1 Spirituality point.
- To summon extraordinary creatures, you need at least 3 Spirituality points.
- Consuming 2 points of Spirituality, extraordinary creatures need to consume more Spirituality to display extraordinary abilities. [[UNCLEAR: The above costs conflict with “consume 2 points of Spirituality” for the swift-action use; unclear whether 2 is a base cost, a minimum, or applies only to some summons.]]

Difficulty modifications by familiarity:

- A certain piece of history that you are not familiar with will add to the Difficulty Value.
- The history you are familiar with will reduce the Difficulty Value.
- Example: the Difficulty Value of items you summon repeatedly can be reduced to 10.

Operational limitations and risks:

- The Spirituality used by historical projection consumes your own Spirituality, including the summoned characters.
- Summoned characters have no intelligence and no dialogue—only instinct. Combat is fought only through instinct or your manipulation.
- If you communicate with the owner of the historical projection in advance and make arrangements in advance, then they can feel the historical projection after you summon it, resonate with it, and then manipulate the historical projection to join the battle and fight on behalf of you.
  - In other words, especially angel-level existence, when you summon the historical projection, they can perceive that the historical projection is summoned. [[Angel-Level]]
- The object you summon should not be your enemy—at least, they cannot be your enemy in the period you summoned—because the historical projection relies only on instinctive actions. If you do not control it (or at the moment you come out), its instinct may attack you, potentially causing you to be backstabbed by your own projection.
- The maintenance time of historical projection is limited. If you use it to summon food, it will disappear after you eat it.
- The historical projection can’t play the full ability. When the historical projection is identified:
  - Total identification is -4.
  - Damage caused each time is -4 (calculated according to the number of times damage is caused; if an attack is 1d4+2d10, there is more than one damage die, but as long as it is a single attack that only hits once, rather than several hits, the damage reduction takes effect only once).
- The historical projection cannot exert the effect of full ability, and it is still effective when the historical projection has obtained the consciousness of the ontology. [[Ontology]]
- If someone summons your historical projection, you can also participate in the battle in a similar way (by resonating/manipulating through it), but your will may also be captured through the historical projection.
  - Across the historical projection can usually halve the **sanity blow** [[sanity blow]] you suffer, but it also means that if you do not enter the fog of history to hide in advance, your body may be in danger because your will has entered the historical projection.
- **Warning:** If you enter the hole of your historical image and are cut off from your ontology, it is almost predictable that your ontology will inevitably lose control.

Progress notes (as written):

- **Completely digested potion:** 2 caps added. [[UNCLEAR: “caps” is not defined; unclear what increases by 2.]]

- **Master of Miracles** [[Master of Miracles]]: The upper limit has become 9, and you can summon familiar scenes, but there are still only three summons at the angel level. [[UNCLEAR: “upper limit has become 9” is not scoped (what limit? summons? scenes?); unclear what it applies to.]]

### Restoring Your Self

- **Use:** Once per round; **swift action**.
- **Cost:** 15 Spirituality points.
- **Effect:** Your health returns to maximum.

### Paper Doll Stand

- **Use:** Once per round; **swift action**.
- **Cost:** 8 Spirituality points, and a paper figure [[paper figure]].
- **Effect:** You can keep a physically disabled creature moving. You instantly restore a creature’s full hit points and remove any disadvantage it has from critical attacks.
- **Limit/Truth check:** The restored hit points are false if he is told, or discerns the truth with a Difficulty Value 15 Inspiration check; then these restored HP disappear instantly. [[UNCLEAR: “if he is told” is undefined (who is told, by whom, and what constitutes being told).]]

### Fog Creation

- **Use:** **spellcasting action**.
- **Cost:** Does not need to consume Spirituality.
- **Effect:** Fill a certain area around you with gray mist (fog from history).
  - The fog can make people hallucinate to a certain extent; most content comes from the past, but usually cannot have effective effects.
  - **Range:** Usually only 100 meters in radius.
  - It can block the vision and spiritual vision [[id:alias-spiritual-vision|spiritual vision]] of demigods [[Demigod]] and below in the area.
  - From the demigod stage, one can use spiritual vision to see through the fog.
  - Only the spirit vision of the fate path [[fate path]] can still exert its normal effect in this fog, barely identifying the target.
  - It can reduce the surrounding temperature and extinguish flames to a certain extent.

> **GM Note:** Other than the effects listed above, this is described as having no more uses and being a non-core skill.

- **Sequence 2 note:** The range of the fog is increased to a radius of one kilometer. [[id:alias-sequence-2|Sequence 2]]
