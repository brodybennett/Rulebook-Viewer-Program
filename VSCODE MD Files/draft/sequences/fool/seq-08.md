- Can rely on intuition to predict a target’s next move.
- Can use ordinary paper as a weapon.
- Can effectively read facial expressions and body language, making lies easier to believe.

## Advancement

## Acting Rules

- Can slightly predict fate, but feel helpless about fate.
- Cover all sadness, pain, confusion, and frustration with a smiling face.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- Strength +1
- Constitution +2
- Dexterity +2
- Inspiration +1 [[Inspiration]]
- Performance and Deceit increase by 1 level [[Performance]] [[Deceit]]

In addition, from now on you will not lose your balance. If you fall, one of your limbs will land firmly. As long as there are still limbs touching the ground, you can stabilize your center of gravity. Even if you fall from a train, as long as you still have a support point, you can still perform acrobatic bounces.

### Premonition of Danger

Also known as intuitive premonition: you can predict the actions of others at critical moments and perceive danger.

- **Use:** Triggered whenever you are raided, sneak attacked, or something on the scene is about to put a raid or sneak attack into action. [[Raid]] [[Sneak Attack]]
- **Use (additional trigger):** If a single instance of damage exceeds half of your maximum health (rounded up), this ability can also be triggered. [[Maximum health]] [[Damage instance]]

When triggered, resolve the following:

1. Make an Inspiration appraisal (**Difficulty Value** 15). [[Appraisal]] [[Difficulty Value]]
   - On success, an idea flashes in your mind immediately, telling you the form the danger will take.
   - After you succeed, you cannot be raided or ambushed.
   - Threats you mistakenly think are “safe” do not trigger this ability.
2. Under the above premise, as long as you are not restrained or otherwise prevented, your **physical defense** gains a +4 temporary bonus. [[Physical defense]] [[Restrained]]
   - Against light and lightning, you retain the agility and dodge in physical defense instead of applying the +4 value. [[Light]] [[Lightning]] [[Dodge]]
3. If the danger’s area is large enough (e.g., a gas explosion across the entire area instantly), even if you are alerted to the danger, you do not gain these benefits. [[Area effect]]

- **Special:**
  - Dangers higher than 1 level cannot be foreseen. [[Danger level]]
  - Hazards dependent on luck are foreseeable, but you gain no benefit.
- **Limits:**
  - As a kind of spiritual intuition, danger premonition is invalidated by anti-divination and anti-prophecy. [[Spiritual intuition]] [[id:alias-anti-divination|Anti-divination]] [[Anti-Prophecy]]

**Sequence progression (future improvements):**
- Sequence 7: The mind changes from flashing thoughts to flashing images, directly showing the manifestation of danger if not avoided.
- Sequence 6: Your Inspiration identification succeeds by default. [[Identification]]
- Sequence 5: You can foresee danger from more than 1 person. [[UNCLEAR: “danger from higher than 1 person” is unclear—likely “more than one person,” but the exact meaning (sources/targets/participants) is not explicit.]]

### Turn Paper into Flying Knives

The soft paper in your hand can turn into flying knives and fly out; this belongs to the magic class. [[Magic class]]

- **Use:** 1 attack action. [[Attack Action]]
- **Effect:** Turn paper and tarot cards into flying blades and throw them, dealing 1d4 + half Strength damage die. [[Strength Damage Die]] [[Tarot Cards]]

Additional rules:

1. Strength damage dice are rounded up to cause physical damage, and are rolled against physical defense. [[Physical Damage]]
2. You can hit consecutively with flying blades and choose multiple targets.
   - You can shoot 3 cards in a row with one attack action.
   - Starting from the second card, you “lose 2 disadvantages” when making the identification throw; you “lose 4 disadvantages” for the third card, and so on, increasing. [[Disadvantages]] [[UNCLEAR: RAW says “lose 2 disadvantages” on the second/third card; it is unclear whether this means you incur Disadvantages or remove them, though context suggests a worsening penalty as you continue.]]

### Muscle Mastery

Your precise mastery of muscles gives you an advantage in learning and fighting.

1. Your muscle-related identification is +2 beneficial, including: fighting, throwing, shooting, performing, deceiving, stealth, etc. [[Beneficial]]
   - Your stealth makes no sound.
   - When listening against stealth, listening without extraordinary factors fails against you by default. [[Listening]] [[Extraordinary Factors]]
2. You get fast dodge, keep complete physical defense against firearms (excluding light and lightning), and gain an extra level of dodge. [[id:alias-fast-dodge|Fast dodge]] [[Firearms]] [[Dodge level]]
3. 1 quick action; does not consume **Spirituality**: your Performance/Climbing/Jumping identification succeeds by default, and the confrontation changes to +4 to benefit. [[Quick Action]] [[Spirituality]] [[Climbing]] [[Jumping]] [[Confrontation]] [[UNCLEAR: “the confrontation is changed to +4 to benefit” is unclear on whether it replaces the auto-success in opposed situations or adds a bonus in place of a normal opposed-roll procedure.]]
4. The Extraordinary of the Audience Path cannot read your thoughts through body language by default. [[Audience Path]] [[Read thoughts through body language]]
5. You learn muscle-related skills faster, once every 24 hours:
   - If you receive relevant courses and guidance, and the content is effective, authentic, non-repetitive, and lasts more than 2 hours, your related skills increase by 1 level. [[Skill level]]
   - From training to proficiency, proficiency to advanced, and advanced to proficient, you need to learn 2, 3, and 4 times respectively; you can reach proficiency at most. [[UNCLEAR: The progression “advanced to proficient” appears to reverse the ladder; the intended tier names/order are not explicit, but the required counts (2/3/4) and cap (“at most proficiency”) are preserved verbatim.]]
   - (This is a potion benefit that cannot be recorded or stolen.) [[Potion benefit]]
