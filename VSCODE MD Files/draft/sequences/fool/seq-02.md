# Sequence 2: Master of Miracles

## Master of Miracles

A **Master of Miracles** can:

- **Resurrection:** Resurrect with the help of the past “spirit worm” (also called “worm of spirit”); this becomes invalid after four times.
- **Influence the Future:** Exert influence on the future by increasing or decreasing the probability of certain things happening, equivalent to interfering with a target’s fate.
- **Historical Pores Summoning:** What is summoned in the historical pores is no longer just objects, but also familiar scenes. There are nine total summon slots/scenes, but only three can be angel level.

### Desire

Only by satisfying other people’s wishes can one’s own wishes be satisfied; only by realizing small wishes first can big wishes be gradually realized.

## Advancement

### Main Material

- A heart of the [[Dark Demonic Wolf]] (God of Wishes), **or**
- A copy of the [[Extraordinary Feature]] of “Master of Miracles”.

### Auxiliary Materials

- 300 milliliters of dark demonic wolf blood
- [[Worm of Time]] ×1
- [[Worm of Star]] ×1

### Advancement Ritual

- Bringing a lost piece of history back to the present.

## Acting Rules

1) Walking in the real world, as the most advanced “magician”, let different people witness “miracles” and fulfill their wishes.  
2) Actively create almost miraculous things in reality and leave corresponding legends.  
3) Miracle is only temporary, fate is always long.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Intuition (INT) +2
- Choose three skills to train.
- One skill is upgraded by one level, excluding miracle skills.

### Wish

- **Effect:** Your skill or attribute checks can now be converted to **Miracle**.

#### Miracle skills from transformed skill checks

After just being promoted:

- These new skills transformed into **Miracle** are independent of the original skills.
- They do not enjoy the skill level of the original skills and do not affect your original skills.
- They are all considered untrained.
- When filling in custom skills, they can be written as “Miracle (Medicine)” (and similar text).

#### Miracle skills from transformed attribute checks

- An attribute you transform is regarded as a new skill, such as “Miracle (Intuition (INT))”.
- Unlike transformed skills, these are initially regarded as trained.
- If you need to use them for miracle determination, you can judge the corresponding skill; this will not affect the attribute bonus of your other skills. The **GM** decides which corresponding skill applies.

#### Growth by fulfilling wishes

- Whenever you fulfill someone else’s wish, choose a miracle skill that corresponds to that wish and raise it by one level.
- Because your miracle skills are basically untrained at the beginning, the way to fulfill other people’s wishes cannot rely on miracle abilities, but through other methods.

> **GM Note:** The RAW gives examples of “other methods,” such as using [[Mask]] Extraordinary items to adjust appearance, or using [[Witch]] items to make someone “Super Super Beautiful.”

> **Lore:** Just like the core of Master of Miracles: “accumulate small wishes and realize big wishes”.

#### Using miracles (skill thresholds and caps)

- Only when one of your miracle skills is proficient (+4) can you use the miracles below; otherwise they cannot be used.
- A miracle skill can reach up to master (+8). After that, the bonus usually cannot continue to increase unless you complete a [[grand miracle]].
- A miracle skill enjoys the additional value of the attribute corresponding to the original skill. Therefore, the miracle master will have certain advantages when performing miracles related to Intuition (INT).

#### Casting miracles (examples)

- A skill test transformed into a miracle can directly complete the result through a Casting Action regardless of material and time constraints.

Examples of successful Miracle checks:

- With a successful **Miracle (Dex)** check, you can complete teleportation.
- With a successful **Miracle (psychological)** test, you can gain insight into another person’s heart.
- With a successful **Miracle (psychological channeling)** check, you instantly regain all of your spirituality and sanity.
- With a successful **Miracle (Medicine)** check, you can completely heal a person instantly.
- Through a successful **Miracle (mystery) identification**, you can wish that the [[Divinity]] of this place disappears:
  - Everyone present cannot use the ability of **Sequence 5** or higher.
  - Duration: 4 rounds.
  - Abilities that have already been displayed will not be affected (e.g., a spirit worm already separated for a secret puppet can still exchange positions with the secret puppet; a mythical form that has been opened will not directly change back to the original state).
- This is because “existence” is reasonable, and for the abilities that have been exerted, make a wish to forget the past (flavor only; no extra action required).

- This will not affect the skill level. For example, even if the divinity disappears, the **Sequence 3** air cannon will still be at the Sequence 3 level of damage.

> **GM Note:** “Miracle” wishes are allowed by other **GMs**.

#### Recording, simulation, and learning

- If a miracle ability is recorded or simulated, the recorded or simulated miracle ability is usually untrained, and only the attribute-shifting miracle ability can be trained to use.
- “Miracle” skills usually need to communicate with a Master of Miracles and learn from that Master of Miracles to obtain it, because records and simulations cannot change the essence, and they are not actually Master of Miracles.

#### Wish targeting limit

- Each wish can only be granted to one target once a day.
  - Example: You can make a wish to restore a target’s spirituality, but you cannot fulfill that target’s wish again within the corresponding time period, unless you change someone else to come and make a wish.
- However, you can make a wish to yourself, and you yourself are a wishing object.

> **Lore:** You need to accumulate small wishes in order to create big miracles. The RAW gives examples such as restoring a whole city to its original state, or affecting the people in a whole city to achieve “miracles,” after accumulating enough.

### Resurrection

- **Trigger:** Whenever you die.
- **Effect:** You are immediately resurrected at the location you choose.
- **Uses:** Generally, a new Master of Miracles has 4 resurrection chances.
- **Reset:** After being promoted to **Sequence 1**, these 4 resurrection chances will be reset.

#### If the four chances are exhausted

- You can still be resurrected, but the next resurrection needs preparation in advance:
  - Prepare a copy of your own **Sequence 2** Extraordinary Characteristics in advance.
  - Place it at the position that needs to be resurrected.
- After you die, you will regenerate at the resurrection point set by you, and integrate this Sequence 2 characteristic to become a Master of Miracles with this Sequence 2 characteristic.
- The Extraordinary characteristic of 9–3 is optional in the characteristic; it does not affect resurrection, but it is better to have it, otherwise it may be difficult to effectively use the low-sequence ability.
  - For details, see Explanation of Sequence Replacement.

#### Additional constraints and setup

- The miracle of “dead and back” is essentially a deep-seated exploitation of the powers of the past, but after four times it will be invalid.
- The resurrection of the body can only take effect in the real world, and must be within a certain range of the remains (GM decides the range).

To make a resurrection point, you need to leave the following at the location to be resurrected:

- At least one [[Spirit Worm]] as a clone
- A copy of the miracle master characteristic of **Sequence 2**
- A bottle of your blood or your body tissue

If resurrected, they will instantly expand and reconstitute your body from nothing.

### Influence the Future

- **Cost:** 5 points of spirituality
- **Use:** A **Swift Action**
- **Effect:** A target you designate will get a +5 bonus on the result of a certain judgment you designate.
- **Limits:** This bonus cannot be superimposed.
