# Sequence 6

## Faceless Man

- You can instantly observe and recall the appearance and temperament characteristics of everyone you know, and grasp their unique smell.
- People who can change into different appearances, as long as the difference in body size is not too large, can imitate height and voice, but cannot imitate voices with mysterious power; it is only a superficial change and does not involve the essence. [2]

## Advancement

### Main Materials

- The mutated pituitary gland of the [[Thousand-Faced Hunter]]
- The characteristics of the [[human-skinned shadow]]

### Auxiliary Materials

- 80ml of the blood of the hunter with thousands of faces [[Thousand-Faced Hunter]]
- 5 drops of [[black mandala juice]]
- 10g of [[dragon tooth grass powder]]
- 3 hairs of [[deep sea naga]]

## Acting

- **Acting principle:** pretending to be someone else.
- You can pretend to be anyone except yourself.
- While integrating into the role and trying to play it, withdraw from emotion and examine it indifferently; through bit-by-bit comparison, recognize yourself and find the truest self, and avoid being negatively affected by the role due to long-term performance.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +2.
- Your fighting skill goes up by 1 level.
- Your disguise goes up by 2 levels.

### Instant Recognition and Recall

1. From now on, as long as you have met a person, you can instantly remember their appearance, temperament, smell, and characteristics.
   - You can also recall this information from people you met before being promoted.
   - If you have only seen a portrait, you may only remember appearance.
2. If the person you have met is disguised, you can only remember the information of the disguise.
   - As long as they can't completely cover up their temperament and behavior habits, even if you don't know their true face, you can find them from the crowd at a glance; the **GM** decides whether this still applies if they disguise again.

### Metamorphosis

- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Cost:** Without expending **spirituality**.
- **Effect:** You undergo a physically permanently altered disguise. You can permanently change into someone with a different appearance, but it is only a superficial change, not a real one.
- **Additional effects:** This allows you to freely adjust **Charisma** between 1â€“6, but does not involve extraordinary strength.
- **Limits and rules:**
  1. You canâ€™t drastically change your body shape. You can only increase or decrease your height by 10 centimeters.
     > **Lore:** This essentially fills your body with excess flesh and blood; increasing outward height implies losing the flesh and blood that previously filled your body.
  2. Transformation does not affect the essence; it only changes appearance, and cannot change with the clothes. At this stage, your change range is not enough to deform the clothes; at most, it is like painting the surface of the body with a layer of oil paint with the same color as the clothes.
  3. The essence and process of deformation is to adjust the position, color, smell, and characteristics of flesh and blood. Therefore, flesh and blood will wriggle and change to a certain extent; you can change skin color and become the appearance of the opposite sex, but it cannot affect your primary sexual characteristics.
  4. As long as you have heard it and remember it, you can also completely imitate the voice of others; the imitated voice does not have extraordinary effects.
- **The potion is fully digested or promoted:** You can be taller or shorter by 15 cm.

### Other Extraordinary Ability Improvements

- **Anti-divination:** You donâ€™t need a [[Paper Doll Substitute]]; you can use any divination props for anti-divination. This usage will not damage the divination props (for example, coin divination can be achieved by making coins roll and jump in the hand), but the occult identification is changed to inspiration identification.
- **Manipulate Fire:** The range of Manipulate Fire has been increased to 40 meters.
- **Flame Leap:** The range of Flame Leap is increased to 40 meters.
- **Air bomb:** Changed to 2d6 physical damage, comparable to the latest rifle.
- **False "breathing underwater":** The thin air tube is changed to a length of 10 meters.
- **Paper Doll Substitute/Damage Transfer:** No significant change, only increased use times due to spiritual growth.
- **Draw paper as a soldier:** When the created weapon hits a hard object, it is damaged 4 times and lasts for 7 minutes.
- **Illusion:** For this ability only, gain a +1 temporary bonus on **Deception** checks.
