# Sequence 4: Bizaro Socerer

## Overview

At this **Sequence**, you gain or improve the following capabilities:

- **Animal Transformation:** You can transform into an animal whose body size is not too big. In the **Spirit State**, you can ignore the size limitation. [[Spirit State]]
- **Wound and Disease Transfer:** You can transfer your own or other people's wounds and diseases to a **Double Paper Doll**. [[Double Paper Doll]]
- **Flame Jump Distance:** You gain a flame-jumping distance of nearly a thousand meters. [[Flame Jump]]
- **Air Bullet:** You gain the power of an **Air Bullet**. [[Air Bullet]]
- **Shell Level:** You are upgraded to the shell level. [[Shell Level]]

## Advancement

### Main Materials

- The main eye of the trickster. [[Trickster]]
- The real soul of the predator in the spiritual world. [[Predator (Spiritual World)]]

### Auxiliary Materials

- 200ml of blood from tricksters. [[Trickster]]
- 30g of dust from spiritual predators. [[Spiritual Predator]]
- 10g of red birch bark. [[Red Birch]]
- A piece of golden vine. [[Golden Vine]]
- A self-made rubber mask the size of a finger.

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Directing—largely by one's own power and planning—in front of a large audience, a grand drama in which a demigod (or equivalent otherworldly creature) is murdered, and then, at the end of the drama, consumed by a potion. [[Demigod]] [[Otherworldly Creature]] [[Potion]]

> **Lore:** Common motifs and “playing rules” include keywords such as “horror,” “director,” and “incomprehensible ability.” The overall presentation is mysterious, unknown, complicated, and fate is elusive—combining into a complete “creepy mage.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +1. [[Inspiration]]
- **Skill Increase:** Choose 1 skill to increase by 1 skill level. You must choose among: Performance, Deceit, Persuasion. [[Performance]] [[Deceit]] [[Persuasion]]

### Spirit Body Thread Control

- **Use:** You can complete the initial control of the **Spirit Body Thread** within three seconds. [[Spirit Body Thread]]
- **Effect:** You can completely transform the target into a puppet within fifteen seconds. [[Puppet]]
- **Targeting and range:** Your control range is 150 meters.
- **Limits:** With the help of **Secret Puppets**, you can increase the control distance of the **Spirit Body Thread** beyond 150 meters, but it cannot exceed the control limit of the body's **Secret Puppets**. [[UNCLEAR: “the control limit of the body's Secret Puppets” is not defined, so the maximum extended distance cannot be resolved from RAW.]]
- **Limits:** When first promoted, you can control up to 50 **Secret Puppets**.

### Exchange Positions

- **Effect:** You and a **Secret Puppet** exchange positions. [[Secret Puppet]]
- **Cost:** 1 swift action, with the same priority as a free action. [[Swift Action]] [[Free Action]]
- **Effect:** Swapping places is a type of teleportation. [[Teleportation]]
- **Targeting and range:** You exchange positions with a **Secret Puppet**, jumping like a flame, with a range of 1 km.
- **Limits:** The flashing of the Analog Door Pathway can be used for an unlimited number of times without intervals, but the **GM** can question that you cannot do so many actions at specific times (for example, switching positions 10 million times in one round). The specific judgment can be found in “Chapter Six: Combat,” which is similar to the apprentice's free-action flash judgment. [[Analog Door Pathway]] [[Chapter Six: Combat]] [[id:alias-apprentice|Apprentice]]
- **Scaling:** Sequence 3: Interchangeable distance up to 5 kilometers.

> **Lore:** This ability allows you to keep exchanging positions with a Secret Puppet and perform “crazy flashes.”

### Endow Marionette with Extraordinary Abilities

- **Use:** You endow a marionette with extraordinary abilities.
- **Cost:** As a free action, spawn an **Ethereal Worm**. [[Ethereal Worm]]
- **Effect:** Allow several of your **Secret Puppets** to obtain all your extraordinary abilities.
- **Limits:** A **Secret Puppet** that does not receive an **Ethereal Worm** is equivalent to the level of Sequence 5 in your control over it. [[Sequence 5]]
- **Limits:** When others use abilities on a **Secret Puppet** without an **Ethereal Worm**, the **Secret Puppet** without the **Ethereal Worm** is not regarded as having divinity. [[Divinity]]

### Psychic Connection

- **Effect:** From now on, your **Spirit Body Thread** can connect to the deep spirit of the marionette, achieving a psychic effect.
- **Psychicism:** **Psychicism** is a state that prevents the spirit body from lying. [[Psychicism]]
- **Initiative:** You can also use this to give the marionette a certain degree of initiative, depending on its consciousness.

- **State of the Secret Puppet:** The **Secret Puppet** can see, hear, and feel, but can't move anything.
- **Psychicism and Movement:** Psychicism can make the **Secret Puppet** move on its own. [[UNCLEAR: RAW states the Secret Puppet “can't move anything,” then later states Psychicism can make it move on its own; the exact scope/limits of movement are not specified.]]

> **GM Note:** If a PC in the group is about to die or lose control, you can consider making them a Secret Puppet, and let the PC recover its own consciousness through psychic communication to live on. However, they can no longer leave your range of one kilometer, and they may be lost in danger. Consider this if another Player is willing to accept it. [[Lose Control]]

### Spirit Worm Principles and Loss

- **Essence (Granting Abilities):** The essence of endowing the marionette with extraordinary abilities is to separate a **Spirit Worm** and let it enter the **Secret Puppet** through the **Spirit Body Thread**. [[Spirit Worm]]
- **Return to Ontology:** If the marionette dies, the characteristics of the **Spirit Worm** in the body will converge according to the extraordinary characteristics for a certain period of time; the law returns to the ontology. If this process is interrupted, it may be lost. [[Ontology]]

#### Loss Effects

- **Self-Connection:** **Spirit Worms** separated to marionettes are considered part of yourself. Therefore, if the **Secret Puppet** with the **Spirit Worm** suffers a loss, you will also be affected to a certain extent.
- **Major Loss Threshold:** When more than 6 **Spirit Worms** are lost at one time, you will immediately suffer the equivalent of your Sanity strikes of mythic creature forms at this level, and enjoy a sanity check bonus. [[Sanity]] [[Sanity Strike]] [[Mythic Creature Form]] [[Sanity Check]] [[UNCLEAR: The phrase “suffer the equivalent of your Sanity strikes … and enjoy a sanity check bonus” does not specify the exact mechanical procedure, timing, or bonus value.]]
- **6 or Less:** As long as the loss of **Spirit Worms** is 6 or less, there will be no major problems: it will only give you headaches and signs of out-of-control tendencies that can be suppressed. One or two losses will not affect the latter; losses in this range can be suppressed for you, especially when your potion digestion is higher. [[Potion Digestion]] [[Out-of-Control]]

#### When a Spirit Worm Is Actually Lost

- **Secret Puppet Loss vs. Spirit Worm Loss:** The loss of a **Secret Puppet** does not necessarily represent the loss of a **Spirit Worm**. Generally speaking, the **Spirit Worm** will still survive after the loss of the **Secret Puppet**; its health is regarded as equal to you, but it cannot use extraordinary abilities independently. [[HP]]
- **Instant Kill Condition:** Only when the **Secret Puppet** suffers an instant-kill blow that exceeds your base HP limit and the **Secret Puppet**'s maximum HP limit will a **Spirit Worm** be lost. [[Base HP Limit]] [[Maximum HP]]

#### Recovering Spirit Worms

- **Free-Action Recovery:** Even if there is a spike strike, as long as you still have time to use a free action, you can immediately recover these **Spirit Worms**, thus directly avoiding similar attacks. [[UNCLEAR: RAW does not specify the exact trigger window, method, or whether this recovery is part of a specific ability; it only states it can be done “as long as you still have time to use a free action.”]]

#### Tolerance by Sequence and Digestion

- **Sequence 4 (Potion Digested):** Can withstand the loss of 12 spirit insects at a time.
- **Sequence 3:** Can withstand the loss of 25 spirit worms at one time, and 50 after the potion is digested.
- **Sequence 2:** Generally speaking, the loss of your Spirit Insect will not affect your existence.
