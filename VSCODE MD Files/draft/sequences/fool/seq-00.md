# Fool Pathway: Sequence 0

## The Fool

- See also: [[LINK LATER: Fool Pathway | type=pathway | hint=pathway overview]]

> **Lore:** The essence of this promotion is to make the promoted feel slightly uncoordinated, unnatural, and abnormal—so that a bit of the spirit transformed from everything resurfaces and regains some self-awareness, preventing them from losing themselves.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual of Ascension:** Fool time, history, or fate once. [[LINK LATER: Ritual of Ascension | type=ritual | hint=advancement ritual framework]] [[LINK LATER: Fooling | type=mechanic | hint=the act of fooling time/history/fate for advancement]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +1. [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute]]
- If you fooled time or history when promoted, **Inspiration** +1.
- If you fooled history when promoted, **Education** +1. [[LINK LATER: Education | type=term | hint=attribute]]
- Regardless of what you fooled to promote, your **History** skill increases by 1 skill level. [[LINK LATER: History (Skill) | type=term | hint=skill name and how skill levels work]]

> **Lore:** Because you have become the incarnation representing the Fool and mastered the three powers of fooling (with only differences in which is stronger or weaker), the **History** skill increase applies no matter what you fooled to promote.

### Divine Gaze

- **Effect:** You can gaze at the surroundings of any creature that recites your **true name**, and you may use your extraordinary abilities to target that area at will. [[LINK LATER: True Name | type=term | hint=reciting a being's true name]]

### God of Blindness and Foolishness

- **Effect:** You gain the following abilities:
  - **Aura of Foolishness**
  - **Fooling**

### Aura of Foolishness

- **Effect:** All creatures within your **field of vision** have their **Inspiration** locked at 1. [[LINK LATER: Field of Vision | type=mechanic | hint=definition and measurement]] [[UNCLEAR: “locked at 1” could mean “set to 1” or “cannot change from 1”; RAW does not specify.]]
- If a creature becomes insane due to a **Sanity roll**, it is immediately **incapacitated** and cannot take any actions until the insanity ends. [[LINK LATER: Sanity Roll | type=mechanic | hint=roll that can cause insanity]] [[LINK LATER: Incapacitated | type=condition | hint=unable to take actions]] [[LINK LATER: Insanity | type=condition | hint=duration/ending conditions]]

### Fooling

- **Use:** **Free action**. [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Limits:** Can be used only once on the same creature in a **round**. [[LINK LATER: Round | type=mechanic | hint=turn/round structure]]
- **Effect:** You declare that what has happened does not exist. When you declare that a thing that happened does not exist, 1 action and all consequences of that action disappear; you cancel the damage it caused, the ability used, and its result.
- **Aftereffects:** This ability does not return **spirituality** lost through using the ability. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource spent to use abilities]]
