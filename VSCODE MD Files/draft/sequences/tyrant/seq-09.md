# Tyrant Pathway: Sequence 9

## Sailor

- **Tarot Correspondence:** [[Tarot Cards]]

> **Lore:** Once called “sea dependents,” Sailors embody dominance across sea, land, and air.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main Material:** [[Murloc Swim Bladder]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1.
- **Skill Gain:** Swimming +1 level; Diving +1 level.

### Swimming and Diving Growth

- **Effect:**
  - Each time you receive **2 hours** of non-repetitive, effective guidance relevant to swimming/diving, your Swimming/Diving skill increases by **+1 level**.
  - You can improve “quickly” up to **Proficiency** at most. [[Skill Levels]]
  - [[UNCLEAR: “You need 2, 3, 4 times” is ambiguous—unclear what those counts apply to (per level? per threshold?).]]
- **Notes:**
  - [[UNCLEAR: “When the character has not just been promoted… swimming growth skill… can be increased by the strength/agility of the potion; growth rate = inspiration” is unclear in timing and application.]]
  - [[Potions]]
  - [[Inspiration]]

### High-Rank Sensitivity

- **Trigger:** When you see another creature/person who is not using **restraint**. [[Restraint]]
- **Effect:**
  - Make an **Inspiration Test** at **Difficulty Value 15**. [[Tests and Difficulty Value]]
  - On a successful judgment, you determine whether the target’s level is higher than yours, and roughly how much higher.
  - If the target is higher by **more than 1 position**, you fall into **Fear**. [[Fear]]
- **Fear Clarification:**
  - Fear applies only toward the **source of fear**.
  - You are not forced to move because of Fear due to friendly targets, but you are still timid.

### Phantom Scale

- **Effect:**
  - You gain **phantom scales** hidden under your skin; when you are injured, the scales emerge to protect you.
  - You gain **+2 Armor** and **+1 External Damage Reduction**. [[Armor and Damage Reduction]]
  - Unless a creature belongs to Sequences such as [[Machine Pathway]] or [[Clown Pathway]] (which can accurately grasp their own strength), most creatures cannot securely grab you—hands slip as if catching a giant fish covered in slick scales. [[Grabbing and Grappling]]
  - Even without protective equipment, you can dive to **15 meters** below the water surface and move freely underwater for **10 minutes**.
- **Sequence Upgrade:**
  - Each time you upgrade your **Sequence**:
    - Armor and External Damage Reduction **+1**
    - Diving depth **+15 meters**
    - Free underwater movement time **+15 minutes**

### Water Breathing

- **Effect:** You gain passive water breathing.
  - You can maintain normal breathing underwater.
  - Base duration is up to **10 minutes** (matched with **Phantom Scale**’s baseline underwater duration).
- **Sequence Boost:** Each boost sequence increases your underwater breathing duration by **+15 minutes**.

### Balance

- **Effect:** You have excellent balance on unstable footing (e.g., stormy ships, earthquakes).
  - You can no longer be thrown off balance. [[Balance and Knockdown Rules]]

### Spirit Vision
- **Use:** 1 **Free Action** to activate.
- **Cost:** 1 **Spirituality Point** per round.
- **Effect:** While Spirit Vision is active, you gain the following benefits:


  1) **Etheric Body:** You can roughly judge whether a target’s physical condition is good or bad from aura color, but you cannot obtain detailed information.
  2) **Spiritual Body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality, but you cannot identify extraordinary people.
  3) **Mental Body:** You can tell whether a target is thinking, but cannot learn more detailed information.
  4) **Astral Body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5) You gain **+1** to your **Spiritual Intuition** test. [[Spiritual Intuition]]
- **Notes:**
  - Dead creatures are usually dull in color and may not be identifiable.
  - Many spiritual materials are “spiritual,” but you cannot determine the corresponding Pathway.
  - Aura colors can help you perceive others in darkness, but you only perceive limited colors; you can still get lost in the dark and cannot use color alone to distinguish undead creatures.
  - Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default if they have not dissipated for **24 hours**; these spirit bodies cannot be recorded or stolen. [[Spirit Bodies]]
