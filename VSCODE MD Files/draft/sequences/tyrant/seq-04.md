## Disaster Linkage Rules (“Final Disaster”)

If multiple different disasters occur simultaneously in the same area, their damage is doubled.

- This is not an Extraordinary Ability.
- It is an environmental disaster interaction rule.
- It cannot be simulated or stolen.
- Any pathway involving disasters may trigger these linkages as a special judgment.

### Non-Stacking Clause

Repeated benefit descriptions from different disaster sources do not stack.

> Example: If lightning gains bonus damage to wet targets in multiple rules, that bonus applies only once.

- This damage represents objects carried by other disasters.
