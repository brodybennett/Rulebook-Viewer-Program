# Sequence 8: Folk of Rage

> **Lore:** Known as the “Storm Guard” in ancient times. When angered, they can unleash attacks beyond normal limits. [[Storm Guard]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1; Constitution +1; Dexterity +1.

- **Enter Rage:** As a [[Free Action]], you may “charge” for 1 [[Round]] (without affecting your actions) and attempt to enter **Rage** with a [[Will Test]] (Difficulty Value 20).  
  [[UNCLEAR: “Free Action” that “spends 1 round without affecting your actions” is unclear—timing and action interaction need confirmation.]]

  - **Alcohol Bonus:** If you have consumed [[Alcohol]], your rage identification gains +1 benefit; if you consumed [[Spirits]], it gains +2 benefit.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “rage identification” is not defined; likely refers to the test to enter Rage, but the exact bonus application needs confirmation.]]

  - **Delayed Test:** If you do not conduct the Will Test in the first round, the Difficulty Value in the second round becomes 15; the third round succeeds by default.  
    [[UNCLEAR: The “charging” procedure (when you are allowed/required to roll) is not fully specified.]]

  - **Anger Target:** Before you start charging, choose an **Anger Target**. After you enter Rage, all your attacks must first attack the source of anger. When the target’s companion tries to block you, you can attack that companion.

  - **Low Health:** If your [[Health]] is less than half, the Difficulty Value to rage against your “traumatizing” target is halved (round down).  
    [[UNCLEAR: “traumatizing your target” is undefined—what qualifies, and which check’s Difficulty Value is being halved?]]

### Rage State

- **Use:** You gain **Rage State** when you successfully enter Rage (see Attribute Gain).

- **Effect:**
  - This benefit is brought by a [[Potion]]; it cannot be stolen or recorded.
  - In Rage State, the effect changes to: Skill and Attribute identification is only **-2 disadvantageous**.
  - Strength +2; Constitution +2; Agility +2.  
    [[UNCLEAR: Both “Dexterity” and “Agility” appear as attributes; confirm whether Agility is separate or should match Dexterity.]]

- **Duration:** Rage State ends only after the source of anger dies/faints, or after you die/faint.  
  [[Unconscious]]

- **Behavior and Limits:**
  1) **Chasing the Enemy:** Even if the enemy escapes, you must first try to catch up.
  2) **Cancel Rage:** At the beginning of each round, you may attempt to quell Rage with a [[Will Test]] (Difficulty Value 15). If you do so, the alcohol advantage becomes disadvantageous.  
     Only your teammates can use any [[id:alias-psychological-guidance|Psychological Guidance]] / [[Social Skills]] to counter your [[Physical Defense]] to cancel your Rage State.  
     [[UNCLEAR: Exact action cost, success condition, and which skills qualify are not fully specified.]]
  3) **Important Things:** If your rage damages your important things, your rage is immediately cleared.  
     [[UNCLEAR: “important things” is not defined.]]
  4) **Fast Dodge:** While in Rage State, you retain full [[Physical Defense]] against [[Guns]] instead of light/lightning, and gain an extra level of [[Dodge]].  
     [[UNCLEAR: “instead of light/lightning” is unclear—needs the core defense/damage reference.]]

### Furious Strike

- **Cost:** 1 [[Attack Action]]. No [[Spiritual Energy]] required.

- **Use:** Only usable while in **Rage State**.

- **Effect:** You punch forward. This attack adds **+1d6** extra damage; the damage type is the same as the original.  
  [[Damage Types]]

- **Limits and Options:**
  1) The use of Furious Strike cannot support the two combos; you do not have enough spare energy to converge your strength.  
     [[UNCLEAR: “two combos” is not defined—needs the combo rules reference.]]
  2) If you use a [[Full-Round Action]] to restrain your breath and squeeze your anger, you can directly use Furious Strike. This blow gains the effect of anger, but you do not really enter Rage State.  
     [[UNCLEAR: What exactly “gains the effect of anger” adds beyond Furious Strike’s listed effect is not fully specified.]]

> **Lore:** Your muscles swell—strong enough to burst an enemy’s head at the end, or break the iron lock of a stone gate.
