  [[Damage Types]]

### Lightning Storm

- **Cost:** 6 [[Spirituality]]  
- **Use:** Casting Action  
- **Effect:**  
  You create a storm of lightning over an area:
  - Damage: 3d10 + your Strength damage bonus as area lightning damage.
  - Attack Roll: +20 [[Disaster Attack Roll]] vs target’s [[Physical Defense]]  
  - This attack ignores Agility (DEX) and evasion.  
    [[Evasion]]

- **Multi-Attack Interaction:**  
  - Lightning Storm is treated as making **at least 5 attacks** for the purpose of substitute-type defenses.  
  - To fully avoid it using substitute skills, at least **3 substitutes** are required, but the confrontation test is performed only once.  
    [[Substitute Skills]]  
    [[Confrontation Test]]  
  - If the target is one Sequence lower than you, the number of substitutes required increases by +1.

- **Split Resolution:**  
  You may divide the effect into three separate instances of lightning damage; roll damage separately for each instance (and apply damage reduction separately).

  This also interacts with luck consumption by a Wheel of Fortune pathway Sequence 5 ability used to avoid a demigod domain ability, doubling the luck consumption.  
  [[Demigod Domain]]

- **Weather Interaction:**  
  - In heavy rain, Lightning Storm counts as 5 attacks.  

- **Sequence 2 Upgrade (Future):**  
  > **Lore:** At Sequence 2, the lightning storm becomes a “sea of thunder.”  
  - Damage increases by +1d10.  
  - Base number of attacks becomes 5 (6 in rainy weather).

- **Special Targets:**  
  - Airborne or undead targets take an additional **2d10 lightning damage**.  
    [[Undead]]  
  - Targets in a lightning state take an additional **1d10 lightning damage**.  
    [[Lightning State]]

- **Damage Reduction Interaction:**  
  - Damage reduction is applied separately to each lightning damage instance.  
  - Each 1d10 component is reduced individually, including extra damage and Strength-based damage.  
    [[Damage Reduction]]

- **Aftereffects (Paralysis):**  
  - Lightning inflicts a paralyzing effect.  
  - Targets with lightning resistance are unaffected by this paralysis.  
    [[Lightning Resistance]]  
  - To remove paralysis, the target must use an action (not a free action) to pass a Constitution test with Difficulty 15.  
    [[Constitution Test]]  
    Difficulty Value  
  - On failure, the target cannot perform attack or movement actions and does not return to normal until after the opponent’s next round of actions.  
  - If the target is in a wet state, the Difficulty increases to 20.  
    [[Wet State]]

### Ocean Perception

- **Effect:**  
  While in contact with sea water, you can:
  - Perceive events occurring on the waters connected to you.  
  - Observe any location on the sea.  
  - Use your extraordinary abilities anywhere on the sea.  

- **Limits:**  
  - This perception can be affected by anti-divination.  
    [[id:alias-anti-divination|Anti-Divination]]  
- The effective range is approximately the size of a city.  
  - **Clarification:** Treat this as roughly a 5 km radius of connected sea.
