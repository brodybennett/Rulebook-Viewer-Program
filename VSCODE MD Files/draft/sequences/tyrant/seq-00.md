### Celestial Thunder

- **Effect:**  
  - You can create planet-level violent lightning waves.  
  - All lightning-related abilities you use deal **+1d10 lightning damage**. This bonus is calculated separately and also increases the base 5d6 lightning damage of your lightning abilities.  
  - When you use [[Yi Lei Wan Tang]], although it requires a single primary body as the main target, you also deal significant damage each round to other nearby creatures besides the main target. This additional damage is treated as damage from [[Lightning Storm]].  
  - This secondary damage benefits from **Celestial Thunder**’s bonus damage and requires a disaster-damage identification equivalent to Lightning Storm.  
    [[UNCLEAR: The exact procedure for “disaster-damage identification” is not defined here.]]  

- **Targeting and range:**  
  - Within 100 meters of any lightning you create, a powerful electromagnetic storm accompanies it, destroying all information structures.  
  - Informational creatures of the [[Voyeur Pathway]] cannot avoid your lightning damage.  
  - Your lightning can cover the entire world. If you choose, you can keep a planet continuously filled with your lightning storms.

### Sweeping Tides

  - All your water-related damage is increased by **+1d10**, and the upper damage limit is greatly increased.  
  - You can use ocean-related abilities (such as waves) to submerge all land on a planet, turning it into a world consisting only of oceans.
