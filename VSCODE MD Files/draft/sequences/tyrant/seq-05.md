# Ocean Pathway: Sequence 5

## Ocean Singer

A **Ocean Singer** possesses shallow mastery over lightning, greatly enhanced underwater capability, and the power to influence others through song. Depending on personal disposition, their singing may interfere with a target’s **Spirit Body**, shock foes like thunder, or provoke rage through discordant sound.

> **Lore:** Ocean Singers are said to harmonize with the sea itself, their voices carrying both calm and catastrophe beneath the waves.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Consume the potion while inside the stomach of an **Obnish**.

### Advancement Function

After consuming the potion:

- You hear the voices of all creatures across the surrounding sea area.
- The stomach of the **Obnish** blocks and blurs these voices, preventing loss of control during advancement.
- Invisible sound waves continuously burst within your body, causing minor tearing to the **Spirit Body**.
- The mucus lining of the **Obnish** reflects these sound waves back inward, gradually sanding and stabilizing them, similar to material refined in a furnace.
- You involuntarily emit sound during this process.
