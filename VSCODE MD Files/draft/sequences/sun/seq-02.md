# Sequence 2: The Lightseeker

## The Lightseeker

- Also known as: “Sunstrider”.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** When the sun is at its hottest, go to a region close to absolute zero. After taking the potion, with miniature stars erupting in your body, survive in the “bottom of the sea” that boils almost instantly under the sun. When blazing temperature erupts from your body, you are successfully promoted.

> **GM Note:** The source labels this an “unofficial ceremony.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Dexterity +1; Inspiration +1; Constitution +1; Religion +1 skill level; Mystic +1 skill level.

### Incarnate Sun

- **Cost:** 10 **spiritual points** [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Points | type=term | hint=Core Rules resource]]
- **Use:** **Casting action** (1 turn) [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=Core Rules]]
- **Duration:** 1 round (the sun persists continuously for this round).
- **Effect:**
  - You let a real sun descend here; its golden, brilliant white radiance bursts from your body and covers everything.
  - The dazzling scorching sun will melt away all evil, depravity, immortality, and even sacred damage lower than your personality.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “sacred damage lower than your personality” is undefined—unclear what “personality” threshold means and how “sacred damage” is ranked.]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Personality | type=term | hint=Stat/trait threshold]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Sacred Damage | type=mechanic | hint=Damage classification]]
  - In the extreme blazing sun, **Darkness Spear** and other solar powers that are lower than your level are melted directly and invalidated before they are completely condensed. This also includes the **God of War’s Sword of Dawn** and its corresponding **Storm of Light**.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “Darkness Spear and other solar powers” appears contradictory (Darkness vs solar); unclear which category is intended.]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Darkness Spear | type=mechanic | hint=Power/attack]]  
    [[LINK LATER: God of War | type=faction | hint=Deity/source of powers]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Sword of Dawn | type=mechanic | hint=God of War power]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Storm of Light | type=mechanic | hint=God of War power]]
  - In short, all attacks from the sacred domain (lower than your Sequence level) are melted into a part of light.  
    [[LINK LATER: Sacred Domain | type=mechanic | hint=Attack/source category]]
  - This round of sunlight dispels surrounding evils and corresponding shadows, including curses and invisibility, and you enjoy the effect of the realm of no darkness.  
    [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=condition | hint=Core Rules]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Invisibility | type=condition | hint=Core Rules]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Realm of No Darkness | type=mechanic | hint=Area effect]]
  - Damage (each round while the sun persists):
    - Dark, corrupt, undead, and other evil creatures immediately and continuously suffer **6d6+5 holy damage**, and each round increases by **+1d6** (maximum **10d6+5**).  
      [[LINK LATER: Dark | type=other | hint=Creature tag]]  
      [[LINK LATER: Corrupt | type=other | hint=Creature tag]]  
      [[LINK LATER: Undead | type=other | hint=Creature tag]]  
      [[LINK LATER: Holy Damage | type=mechanic | hint=Damage type]]
    - Creatures other than dark, corrupt, or undead take **3d6+5 holy or fire damage** per round (nonincreasing).  
      [[LINK LATER: Fire Damage | type=mechanic | hint=Damage type]]
- **Targeting and range:**
  - The range can cover a city at most.
  - Any creature within **1 kilometer** of the sun that relies on sight to identify directions is considered **blind** due to the strong light.  
    [[LINK LATER: Blind | type=condition | hint=Core Rules]]
  - All areas you can see are covered by extreme daylight.
- **Limits:**
  - This skill automatically interrupts immediately when you are unable to perform the corresponding casting action.
