- **Cost:** 10 **spiritual points** [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** **Casting Action** (1 turn) Casting Action
- **Duration:** 1 round (the sun persists continuously for this round).
- **Effect:**
  - You let a real sun descend here; its golden, brilliant white radiance bursts from your body and covers everything.
  - The dazzling scorching sun will melt away all evil, depravity, immortality, and any sacred damage generated by sources with **Personality** lower than yours.
    [[Personality]]  
    [[Sacred Damage]]
  - In the extreme blazing sun, **Darkness Spear** and other opposing powers lower than your level are melted directly and invalidated before fully condensing. This also includes the **God of War's Sword of Dawn** and its corresponding **Storm of Light**.  
    [[Darkness Spear]]  
    [[God of War]]  
    [[Sword of Dawn]]  
    [[Storm of Light]]
  - In short, all attacks from the sacred domain (lower than your Sequence level) are melted into a part of light.  
    [[Sacred Domain]]
  - This round of sunlight dispels surrounding evils and corresponding shadows, including curses and invisibility, and you enjoy the effect of the realm of no darkness.  
    [[Curse]]  
    [[Invisibility]]  
    [[Realm of No Darkness]]
  - Damage (each round while the sun persists):
    - Dark, corrupt, undead, and other evil creatures immediately and continuously suffer **6d6+5 holy damage**, and each round increases by **+1d6** (maximum **10d6+5**).  
      [[Dark]]  
      [[Corrupt]]  
      [[Undead]]

    - Creatures other than dark, corrupt, or undead take **3d6+5 holy or fire damage** per round (nonincreasing).  
      [[Fire Damage]]
- **Targeting and range:**
  - The range can cover a city at most.
  - Any creature within **1 kilometer** of the sun that relies on sight to identify directions is considered **blind** due to the strong light.  
    [[Blind]]
  - All areas you can see are covered by extreme daylight.
- **Limits:**
  - This skill automatically interrupts immediately when you are unable to perform the corresponding Casting Action.
