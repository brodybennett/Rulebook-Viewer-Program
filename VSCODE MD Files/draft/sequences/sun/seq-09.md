# Sun Pathway: Sequence 9

## Bard

> **Lore:** A mythical creature in the form of the sun, corresponding to [[Tarot Card — Sun]].

- Core theme: praise the sun; bolster courage, strength, piety, and obedience through song.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:** [[Midsummer Grass]], [[July Wine Juice]], [[Fairy Dark Leaf]]

### Advancement Ritual

- **Main Materials:** [[Crystallized Sunflower]] **or** [[Flintbird Tail Feather]] **or** [[Arsonbird Tail Feather]], plus [[Siren’s Stone]] **or** [[Singing Sunflower]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** [[Attributes]] — +1 [[Strength]], +1 [[Agility]], +1 [[Inspiration]], +1 [[Constitution]]
- You can begin learning [[Singing]] quickly.

### Singing Training

- Each time you receive 2 hours of effective guidance (no repetition), your Singing level increases by 1.
  It takes 2, 3, and 4 training sessions to become proficient, advanced, and mastery respectively; the maximum is mastery.

### Potion-Assisted Growth

- When creating a character that is not "just promoted," you can use the [[Bard Potion]] to apply **double the potion's Inspiration bonus** to add growth skills.

### Song of Courage

- **Cost:** 2 **[[Spirituality]]**.
- **Use:** 1 **[[Spell-Casting Action]]**; perform a **[[Singing Identification]]** ( **[[Difficulty Value]]** 15 ); roleplay the corresponding chant. The chant must be themed around praising the sun.
- **Effect:** On a success, you and any friendly unit that heard the singing gain +1 Strength and +1 Agility for 1 **[[Encounter]]**.
- **Effect:** Also clears the physical effects of [[Fear]], [[Poisoning]], [[Curse]], [[Darkness]], [[Corruption]], and [[Undeath]] from affected targets. These effects can be applied again later.
- **Limits:** Fears, poisons, and curses from sources 2+ Sequences higher than you are unaffected.

### Sing Piety

- **Cost:** 2 **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** 1 **Spell-Casting Action**; perform a **Singing Identification** ( **Difficulty Value** 15 ); roleplay the corresponding chant. The chant must be themed around praising the sun.
- **Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

  - **Benefit A (Allies):** You and friendly units gain 1d2 **[[Temporary Sanity]]** for 1 Encounter. During the Encounter, Sanity loss is first applied to Temporary Sanity. Temporary Sanity does not count toward the [[Madness]] caused by Sanity loss.
  - **Benefit B (Opposition):** Use your Singing Identification result against the **[[Will Defense]]** of an enemy who heard the singing; this benefit takes effect only if it succeeds.  
    Dark, corrupt, and undead beings who hear the singing become hard to fight against you: you and friendly units gain **[[Advantage]]** against enemies affected by the singing (i.e., +2 to [[Skill Check]] and [[Attribute Check]]). The enemy does not gain disadvantage. Duration: 1 Encounter.

- **Limits:** The effect is ineffective for corresponding creatures that are 1 Sequence higher than you; they only feel uncomfortable.

### Spirit Vision
- **Use:** 1 **Free Action** to activate.
- **Cost:** 1 **Spirituality Point** per round.
- **Effect:** While Spirit Vision is active, you gain the following benefits:


  1. **Etheric Body:** You can roughly tell whether a creature’s physical condition is good or bad from aura color, but you cannot get detailed information.
  2. **Spiritual Body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality; you cannot identify Beyonders.
  3. **Mental Body:** You can see whether the other party is thinking, but you cannot get more detailed information.
  4. **Astral Body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5. While Spirit Vision is active, your **[[Spiritual Intuition]]** tests gain +1.

- **Notes:**
  - Dead creatures are usually dull in color and cannot be identified.
  - Spiritual materials are usually spiritual, but you cannot determine the corresponding Pathway.
  - Spirit Vision lets you perceive colors in darkness; you can see the existence of colors, but can still get lost (your visible color range is limited). You cannot use these colors to distinguish undead creatures.
  - Spirit Vision can, by default, see some ordinary spirit bodies that have not dissipated for 24 hours; they cannot be recorded or stolen.
