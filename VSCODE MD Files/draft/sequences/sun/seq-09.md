# Sun Pathway: Sequence 9

## Bard

> **Lore:** A mythical creature in the form of the sun, corresponding to [[LINK LATER: Tarot Card — Sun | type=other | hint=Tarot]].

- Core theme: praise the sun; bolster courage, strength, piety, and obedience through song.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:** [[LINK LATER: Midsummer Grass | type=item]], [[LINK LATER: July Wine Juice | type=item | hint=five drops]], [[LINK LATER: Fairy Dark Leaf | type=item]]

### Advancement Ritual

- **Main Materials:** [[LINK LATER: Crystallized Sunflower | type=item]] **or** [[LINK LATER: Flintbird Tail Feather | type=item | hint=adult]] **or** [[LINK LATER: Arsonbird Tail Feather | type=item]], plus [[LINK LATER: Siren’s Stone | type=item]] **or** [[LINK LATER: Singing Sunflower | type=item]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** [[LINK LATER: Attributes | type=rule | hint=Core Rules]] — +1 [[LINK LATER: Strength | type=term | hint=Attribute]], +1 [[LINK LATER: Agility | type=term | hint=Attribute]], +1 [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=Attribute]], +1 [[LINK LATER: Constitution | type=term | hint=Attribute]]
- You can begin learning [[LINK LATER: Singing | type=mechanic | hint=Art skill]] quickly.

### Singing Training

- Each time you receive 2 hours of effective guidance (no repetition), your Singing level increases by 1.
- [[UNCLEAR: Training ranks are self-contradictory (“proficient, advanced, and proficient” and “maximum…proficient”).]]  
  It takes 2, 3, and 4 training sessions to become proficient, advanced, and proficient respectively; the maximum can be improved to proficient.

### Potion-Assisted Growth

- [[UNCLEAR: “twice the inspiration” is unclear (double the Inspiration attribute? double a resource? something else).]]  
  When creating a character that is not “just promoted,” you can use the [[LINK LATER: Bard Potion | type=item | hint=Sun Pathway Sequence 9]] to bring twice the inspiration to add growth skills.

### Song of Courage

- **Cost:** 2 **[[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource]]**.
- **Use:** 1 **[[LINK LATER: Spell-Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]**; perform a **[[LINK LATER: Singing Identification | type=mechanic | hint=check]]** ( **[[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=term | hint=Core Rules]]** 15 ); roleplay the corresponding chant. The chant must be themed around praising the sun.
- **Effect:** On a success, you and any friendly unit that heard the singing gain +1 Strength and +1 Agility for 1 **[[LINK LATER: Encounter | type=mechanic | hint=duration]]**.
- **Effect:** Also clears the physical effects of [[LINK LATER: Fear | type=condition]], [[LINK LATER: Poisoning | type=condition]], [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=condition]], [[LINK LATER: Darkness | type=condition]], [[LINK LATER: Corruption | type=condition]], and [[LINK LATER: Undeath | type=condition]] from affected targets. These effects can be applied again later.
- **Limits:** [[UNCLEAR: The threshold “greater than 1 character or 2 Sequence levels of yours” is unclear.]]  
  Fears, poisons, and curses greater than 1 character or 2 Sequence levels of yours are unaffected.

### Sing Piety

- **Cost:** 2 **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** 1 **Spell-Casting Action**; perform a **Singing Identification** ( **Difficulty Value** 15 ); roleplay the corresponding chant. The chant must be themed around praising the sun.
- **Effect:** Choose one of the following benefits:

  - **Benefit A (Allies):** You and friendly units gain 1d2 **[[LINK LATER: Temporary Sanity | type=mechanic | hint=sanity buffer]]** for 1 Encounter. During the Encounter, Sanity loss is first applied to Temporary Sanity. Temporary Sanity does not count toward the [[LINK LATER: Madness | type=condition | hint=from Sanity loss]] caused by Sanity loss.
  - **Benefit B (Opposition):** Use your Singing Identification result against the **[[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense]]** of an enemy who heard the singing; this benefit takes effect only if it succeeds.  
    Dark, corrupt, and undead beings who hear the singing become hard to fight against you: you and friendly units gain **[[LINK LATER: Advantage | type=mechanic | hint=skill/attribute check +2]]** against enemies affected by the singing (i.e., +2 to [[LINK LATER: Skill Check | type=mechanic]] and [[LINK LATER: Attribute Check | type=mechanic]]). The enemy does not gain disadvantage. Duration: 1 Encounter.

- **Limits:** [[UNCLEAR: “ineffective for corresponding creatures that are 1 higher than you” is ambiguous (1 Sequence higher? other measure?).]]  
  The effect is ineffective for corresponding creatures that are 1 higher than you; they only feel uncomfortable.

### Spirit Vision

- **Cost:** 1 **Spirituality** per round (while active).
- **Use:** 1 **[[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]** to activate Spirit Vision.
- **Effect:** While Spirit Vision is active, you gain the following benefits:
  1. **Etheric Body:** You can roughly tell whether a creature’s physical condition is good or bad from aura color, but you cannot get detailed information.
  2. **Spiritual Body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality; you cannot identify Beyonders.
  3. **Mental Body:** You can see whether the other party is thinking, but you cannot get more detailed information.
  4. **Astral Body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5. While Spirit Vision is active, your **[[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition | type=mechanic | hint=test]]** tests gain +1.

- **Notes:**
  - Dead creatures are usually dull in color and cannot be identified.
  - Spiritual materials are usually spiritual, but you cannot determine the corresponding Pathway.
  - Spirit Vision lets you perceive colors in darkness; you can see the existence of colors, but can still get lost (your visible color range is limited). You cannot use these colors to distinguish undead creatures.
  - Spirit Vision can, by default, see some ordinary spirit bodies that have not dissipated for 24 hours; they cannot be recorded or stolen.
