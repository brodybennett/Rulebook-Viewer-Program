# Sun Pathway: Sequence 8

## The Light Suppliant

- You can perform some spells and rituals in the [[Solar Realm]].
- You are very restrained by dead bodies and [[Ghosts]]. [[MISSING REF: 9]]
- [[UNCLEAR: “Very restrained by dead bodies and ghosts” states a constraint but does not specify the mechanical effect (vulnerability, suppression, prohibition, etc.).]]

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main Materials (choose one):**
  - [[Glowstone]]
  - [[Blazing Soul Powder]]
  - [[Mirror Hedgehog Blood]]
  - [[Lava Troll Heart]]
- **Auxiliary Materials:**
  - [[Phnom Penh Sunflower]] ×1
  - [[Aconite Juice]] ×3 drops

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1; Agility +1; Inspiration +1; Constitution +1.
- **Rapid Improvement:** Mysticism is included in the category of [[Rapid Improvement]] and can be quickly improved to [[Proficiency]].

### White Vision

> **Lore:** Golden sunlight gathers in your eyes until they resemble two miniature suns.

- **Cost:** 1 **[[Spirituality]]** every 1 minute.
- **Use:** 1 **[[Swift Action]]** to activate.
- **Effect:**
  - You can see in total darkness.
  - Anything hidden by darkness or shadow is revealed.
- **Limits:**
  - This ability belongs to **[[Summoning Light]]**.
  - If Summoning Light is lost, this ability disappears (and vice versa).
- [[UNCLEAR: “1 spirituality every 1 minute” does not specify whether this is an activation cost, a maintenance cost, or how ending the effect works.]]

### Brightness

> **Lore:** You raise your arms in prayer and emit pure, clear radiance.

- **Use:** 1 **[[Casting Action]]**.
- **Cost:** Each round consumes 2 **[[Spirituality]]**.
- **Duration:** Maintenance continues to consume Casting Actions.
- **Targeting and range:** With you as the center, you illuminate a 10-meter area with divine power.
- **Effect:**
  - In this area, the effects of darkness, corruption, and undead that are not higher than you by 1 character level or 2 Sequence levels will be cleared.
  - As long as the radiance is maintained, dark, corrupted, and undead creatures in the area begin to suffer **[[Holy Damage]]** equal to your **Restrained Damage** each round.
  - [[Resentful Soul]] is exposed to spiritual vision; when taking damage, its body begins to “vaporize.”
- **Sequence 7:**
  - It can be replaced by a clear and warm power that ordinary people cannot detect, and it does not need to bloom.
  - [[UNCLEAR: The Sequence 7 replacement text does not clearly state what “it” refers to (the light, the entire effect, visibility to others, etc.).]]
- [[UNCLEAR: “Effects of darkness, corruption, and undead” is unclear about whether “undead” is an effect category, a creature type reference, or both.]]

### Call the Holy Light

> **Lore:** A pure beam of light wrapped in flames descends from the roof or sky.

- **Use:** 1 **[[Casting Action]]**.
- **Cost:** Consume 3 **[[Spirituality]]**.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within your field of vision.
- **Resolution:** **[[Occult vs Physical Defense]]**, ignoring Agility and Evasion in Physical Defense.
- **Effect:** Deal 2d6 Holy damage and 1d6 Fire damage.
- **Sequence 7:** Damage changes to 3d6 Holy damage and 1d6 Fire damage.

### Purification

> **Lore:** You pray to cleanse filth and corruption.

- **Use:** 1 **[[Casting Action]]**.
- **Cost:** Consume 2 **[[Spirituality]]**.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within 10 meters.
- **Limits:** Unlike “Call the Holy Light,” this ability does not cause damage to ordinary creatures (except as noted below).
- **Effect (Voluntary target):** Purification succeeds by default and removes the following effects (excluding out-of-control, near-out-of-control, permanent madness, etc.):
  - See **[[Conditions]]**.
- **Special (Voluntary restrained creature):**
  - It deals 1d6 Holy damage and the creature is restrained, although it also clears the effect.
- **Effect (Involuntary target):**
  - Resolve with **[[Occult vs Physical Defense]]**; on success, apply the same clearing effect as above.
- **Clearing stronger effects:**
  - An effect caused by more than 1 character level or 2 Sequence levels above yours needs 4 uses to be completely cleared.
  - After 2 uses, the effect is halved (rounded down).
  - It may not be cleared if it is greater than 2 characters.
  - [[UNCLEAR: “Greater than 2 characters” is unclear (character levels? number of characters affected? something else).]]
- **Sequence 7:**
  - Requires 3 uses to completely clear effects caused by more than 1 character level or 2 Sequence levels above yours.
  - The effect is halved after 1 use.

### Sun Path Restraint

- **Restraint Rule:** **Holy Damage** is restrained against three creature types—dark, corrupted, and undead—and causes additional effects.
- When you hit a dark, corrupted, or undead creature with an offensive Sun Path extraordinary ability (including [[Solar Holy Water]]), increase damage as follows:
  - **Dark creatures:** +1d6 Holy damage.
  - **Corrupted creatures:** +2d6 Holy damage.
  - **Undead:** +3d6 Holy damage.
- **Restrained Damage:** The bonus Holy damage from the restraint rule above.
- If a holy effect is a “transmutation ability,” its secondary effect (which may deal Holy damage equal to Restrained Damage) is listed separately (e.g., Brightness).
- Creature typing is marked in the corresponding pathways (example: [[Moon Pathway: Sequence 7]]).

### Solar Rituals

- You have mastered some rituals in the solar realm.
- This is knowledge brought by the potion, so it cannot be stolen or recorded.
- In the Fifth Age, the object of prayer is **[[Eternal Sun]]** by default. [[Fifth Age]]

**Holy Water Prayer**

> **Lore:** Golden rainwater emerges above the altar and converges into a bottle of sun-blessed liquid.

- **Process:** A general ritual process of about 5 minutes.
- **Creates:** 1 bottle of [[Solar Holy Water]] (golden liquid).
- **Solar Holy Water (use):**
  - **Resolution:** Throwing against Physical Defense.
  - **Effect on normal creatures:** No effect.
  - **Effect on restrained types:** Deal 2d6 Holy damage to dark, corrupted, undead, and other creatures; apply Sun Path restraint; the creature begins to “vaporize.”
  - **Additional effects:**
    1. For creatures sprinkled with holy water, cold-related effects are cleared (including restrained creatures).
    2. Normal creatures taking holy water gain 5 points of cold, curse, and poison resistance for 5 minutes, and the cold effect is cleared.
    3. If there are resentful spirits or ghosts in the user’s body, it causes damage to them while the user gains the benefits.

**Purification Ritual**

- **Process:** A general ritual process of about 5 minutes.
- **Effect:** You entrust the gods to solve power you cannot cleanse.
  1. When the ritual is completed, the god you prayed to performs purification; the target must be within the area of the **[[Ritual Magic]]**.
  2. If the effects of the purified darkness, corruption, and immortality are not higher than the prayed-to target by 2 characters, they can be completely cleared.
- **Special:**
  - In the case of more than two persons, it usually depends on the severity of the pollution.
  - If the pollution is only a part of indirect force, it can be completely eliminated. Otherwise, it generally leaves hidden dangers.
  - “Indirect power” generally means you did not provoke the other party’s direct “care,” and the effect is not directly exerted by the other party’s body.
  - [[UNCLEAR: “More than two persons” is unclear (number of targets, number of participants, or a mistranslation of “more than two characters”).]]

**Salvation Ritual**

- **Process:** A general ritual process of about 5 minutes.
- **Effect:** You create a relatively safe area for the sun.
  1. When the ritual is completed, the ritual area continues to be covered with warm, clear power; any dark, corrupt, undead, and other creatures in the area continuously suffer sacred damage equal to Restrained Damage each round.
  2. At the same time, normal creatures in the area continuously receive the same benefits as Solar Holy Water; this remains valid for 5 minutes after leaving the area.
- > **GM Note:** In a dangerous area, this ritual provides temporary safety but may not be decisive for escape.

**Using Solar Rituals Without Following the Eternal Blazing Sun**

- A Sun Path Extraordinary who is not a follower of the **[[Eternal Blazing Sun]]** can still use the rituals above if they have mastered sufficient methods to please the relevant gods.
- Even so, they must make a **[[Lucky Appraisal]]** to get a response.
- If you believe in a god hostile to the Eternal Blazing Sun, there may be no response at all.
