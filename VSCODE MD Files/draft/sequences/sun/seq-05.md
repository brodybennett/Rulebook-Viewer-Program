# Sequence 5: Priest of Light

## Priest of Light

You master magic of the [[Sun Domain]] and can purify dead spirits and filthy creatures within a certain range, making you a natural nemesis of dead spirits. [9]

## Advancement

### Main Materials

- **Main Materials:** The red crown of the Rooster King of Dawn; a piece of pure white glow stone.

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:** 5 grams of rosemary; 7 drops of golden hand orange juice; 10 ml of rock water; 60 ml of the blood of the King of Dawn Rooster.

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** In pure darkness, bury your whole body in ice that normally doesn’t melt, then take the potion.

> **Lore:** *(Unofficial)* The divine power at the time of promotion may cause the Beyonder to be purified or even “melted,” so counteractive darkness and ice are used to balance this holiness and scorching heat. Like Icarus flying to the sun, what matters is staying balanced—neither too high nor too low, neither too much nor too little.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1; Agility +1; Inspiration +1; Constitution +1.
- Occult skills can be quickly upgraded to master.

**Sun Spells:** You are greatly enhanced in the [[Sun Domain]]. You gain the following new Sun spells. Most are enhancements of previous abilities, but due to qualitative changes they are treated as separate abilities.

### Divine Light

You cause a pure, blazing, thick beam of light to fall from above out of thin air.

- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Cost:** 4 **Spirituality Points**.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within line of sight. People standing together are regarded as the same target.
- **Resolution:** Mysticism counters [[Physical Defense]]. This ignores Agility and Dodge in physical defense.
- **Effect:** After the identification is successful, a pure and blazing beam descends directly, vaporizing the target and dealing **4d6 holy** and **2d6 fire** damage, enjoying the [[Restraint Effect]].
- **Special:** Divine Light also has the scorching white visual effect associated with this ability.

### Purification Aura

Your halo-like effect dyes the surroundings golden, spreading outward layer by layer.

- **Use:** Swift action; once per round.
- **Cost:** 2 **Spirituality Points**.
- **Effect:** Dye your surroundings golden, spreading outward, warming allies around you and bringing intense courage. This is not a continuous ability.
- **Targeting and range:** Affects an area within 50 meters. You can precisely control which creatures are affected (including yourself).
- **Cleansing:** Creatures in the aura clear the effects of fear, darkness, poison, cold, immortality, etc. (see [[Conditions]]).
- **Resistance:** Creatures in the aura gain 5 points of resistance to curse, cold, and poison for 3 rounds.
- **Stacking:** This cannot be superimposed with holy water and the [[Body of the Sun]].
- **Against dark/fallen/undead:** If there are dark, fallen, undead, and other creatures in range, and you intend not to let light surround them, then the occult resists [[Physical Defense]], ignores agility and evasion, and successfully deals holy damage equal to the restrained damage. You can decide whether they enjoy the benefits too.  
  [[UNCLEAR: Whether this harmful resolution replaces the aura’s benefits for those creatures, or is an additional option applied at the same time.]]

### Holy Rain

You create a rain of solar holy water.

- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose an area no longer than 50 meters.
- **Duration:** 5 rounds.
- **Effect:** Let the light shine brightly, as if a round of the sun is rising; holy and pure water drops pour down like rain. This creates a **Holy Water Rain Environment** (see [[Holy Water Rain Environment]]).
- **Holy Water Rain Environment:** At the beginning of each round, dark, corrupt, undead, and other creatures in this area suffer holy damage equivalent to the restrained damage. At the same time, normal creatures continue to gain 5 points of curse, cold, and poison resistance.
- **Special:** This is a celestial phenomenon and environmental effect. Therefore, if there is a creature higher than 1 [[Personality]] of the caster that creates disasters, cold, and other environments, the rain of holy water quickly disappears because it cannot be maintained.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The trigger condition (“higher than 1 personality”) and what qualifies as “create disasters” or similar environments are not defined here.]]

### Holy Baptism

You purify the uncleanness and depravity of a creature.

- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Cost:** 4 spirit points.  
  [[UNCLEAR: Resource name differs in this section (“Spirituality Points” vs “spirit points”).]]
- **Targeting:** Choose the creature in front of you or yourself.
- **Effect:** Clear the following effects: fear, anger, charm, awe, curse, depravity, poison, darkness, temporary madness, uncertain madness, psychological suggestion, hypnosis, etc., excluding out-of-control, near-out-of-control, and permanent madness (see [[Conditions]]).
- **Unwilling target:** If the affected target is unwilling, the occult counters [[Physical Defense]].
- **Aftereffects:** The purified creature gains **1d3 temporary sanity** (cannot be superimposed) for 5 minutes (see [[Sanity]]). This can offset the sanity loss of calculation madness, and it can be converted into sanity protection for promotion (see [[Promotion]]).
- **Restrained target:** If the creature being baptized is a restrained creature, then deal restraint effect damage at the same time (see [[Restraint Effect]]).
- **Special:** The effect of more than 1 character needs to be purified twice; the effect of 1 time is halved; the effect of more than 2 characters cannot be processed.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “More than 1 character / more than 2 characters” is undefined here—unclear what statistic or rating this refers to.]]

### "God Loves the World"

You change celestial phenomena to a certain extent and call out sunshine.

- **Use:** 1 spell-casting action.
- **Cost:** 4 spiritual points.
- **Effect:** You read the corresponding sentence; immediately, bright sunshine appears in the sky. Areas that are currently sunlit are immediately considered **Warm**.
- **Warm Environment:** All cold effects caused by the [[Cold Extraordinary Ability]] are cleared. The cold environment still exists but cannot take effect, but the cleared effect can be reapplied by the cold ability, and the cold environment can also be recreated to cover the sun.

### Additional Sun Domain Spells

- For other Sun Domain spells, see the effects of the Sequence 5 period listed in the Sequence 7 ability (see [[Sequence 7 Ability List]]).  
  [[UNCLEAR: Which specific “Sequence 7 ability” is being referenced is not specified here.]]

> **GM Note:** If a priest of light has obtained the permission of the [[GM]], they can also edit two more divine spells of the Sun Domain. This requires the GM’s permission and must be reasonable.  
> [[UNCLEAR: “Edit two more divine spells” is not defined here (whether this means learn, modify, or create spells).]]
