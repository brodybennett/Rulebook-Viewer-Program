# Sequence 3: Mentor of Justice

## Mentor of Justice

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Separate your own evil personality and reach a consensus with it. Through practice or communication, the evil personality recognizes the righteous personality a little bit, and the righteous personality also recognizes the evil personality a little bit. Finally, merge into one and consume **Devil Medicine** [[Devil Medicine]] (unofficial ceremony).

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Dexterity +1, Inspiration +1, Constitution +1, Charm +2.
- **Skill Gain:** Religion +1 skill level, Occult +1 skill level, Law +1 skill level.

### Holy Sea

- **Effect:** You can accumulate righteous and holy power as **Justice Value** (called â€œjustice,â€ â€œsacred value,â€ or â€œholy valueâ€ in the RAW) and spend it at critical moments to burst out stronger solar path abilities [[Solar Path]].
- **Gaining Justice Value:** Each time you eliminate an existence in the dark, depraved, or undead domains, or perform an **act of justice** [[Act of Justice]], you gain Justice Value as follows:
  - Ordinary evil existence: +1.
  - Sequence 9 or Sequence 8 evil existence: +2.
  - Sequence 7 evil existence: +3.
  - Sequence 6 evil existence: +4.
  - Sequence 5 evil existence: +5.
  - Sequence 4 evil existence: +10.
  - Sequence 3 evil existence: +20.
  - Sequence 2 evil existence: +40.
  - Sequence 1 evil existence: +80.
  - Perform an act of justice: +1d8.
- **Maximum Justice Value:** Your maximum Justice Value equals your maximum **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]] (excluding temporary or external bonuses such as items, buffs, or one-off effects).
  - **Additional Cost:** Each Justice ability costs 3 points of Spirituality per use. Free uses waive Justice Value only; the 3 Spirituality cost still applies.
  - Sequence 2: The maximum number of chances increases to 3; these chances can be continuously saved until consumed.

### Hide by Light

- **Cost:** 10 Justice Value; 3 Spirituality [[Spirituality]].
- **Use:** **Swift action** [[Swift Action]].
- **Duration:** Maintain an encounter [[Encounter]].
- **Effect:** You directly become invisible through precise control of optics. Non-**demigod**-level [[Demigod]] mystics and monsters can’t see your existence. Demigod-level detection can perceive a distorted light outline but does not grant clear sight of you.
### Actification

- **Cost:** 20 Justice Value; 3 Spirituality.
- **Use:** Swift action.
- **Trigger:** An impending **non-holy domain** attack [[Non-Holy Domain]].
- **Effect:** You nullify the triggering attack, but it must be embodied in reality (material or elemental). It cannot be an intangible, conceptual attack. You must be able to perceive the attack being released (line of sight or spiritual perception).
  - When facing ranged artillery, this can directly turn multiple artillery and bullets into light.
  - The radiance immediately purifies surrounding curses and evil influences [[Curse]].

### Symmetra

- **Cost:** 15 Justice Value; 3 Spirituality.
- **Use:** Swift action.
- **Effect:** Choose one thing that suffers loss. You repair changes in reality that were lost due to improper supernatural means.
  - Example: You can restore stolen distance to its original state in one round (e.g., restore the enemy's rear-position distance), thereby returning relative positions to their proper spacing.
- **Limits:** A swift action can only choose one type and target of restoration. Restoring distance cannot restore other things.
- **Additional Effects:**
  - You can choose a target to restore supernatural powers stolen in previous rounds, up to 1d4+1 at a time.
  - You can restore distorted or defrauded orders, causing them to immediately return to their original systems [[Distorted Orders]].
  - This also purifies curses or unholy influences caused by unjust means, and restores:
    - 1d10 **hit points** [[Hit Points]] (if any **unholy damage** [[Unholy Damage]]) and
    - 1d3 **Sanity** [[Sanity]] (if any unholy damage)
    to damage caused by such things.
  - The target you restore is protected for 1 round: any new evil/stealing effect targeting them has its identification difficulty increased by 10 points; if the target must break free, reduce that break-free difficulty by 10 points.
### Zhengyao Wings

- **Cost:** 15 Justice Value; 3 Spirituality.
- **Use:** **Free action** [[Free Action]].
- **Limits:**
  - Not subject to the daily free-use limit of Justice abilities; this ability’s uses are tracked separately.
- **Effect:** Once per round, you strengthen the spell effect of your **Sun domain** [[Sun Domain]] once. This can be superimposed with **Fire of Light** [[Fire of Light]].
  > **Lore:** Two pure white wings spread out on the front of the effect (for example, the **Darkness Spear** [[Darkness Spear]]), with clustered tips like angels.
- **Bonuses (apply to the strengthened effect):**
  - Offensive solar path abilities: increase damage by 2d10; gain +5 against checks; gain an additional 1d10 damage bonus against darkness, evil, and undead. This additional bonus takes effect only once per use.
  - The effect of enhanced solar power is increased by half.
  - The ability to restore gets double the effect.
  - Radiance-type effects increase range and strength; within the radiance range, everyone gains 1d3 **temporary sanity armor** [[Temporary Sanity Armor]]. This sanity-armor benefit applies only once per encounter. [[Radiance]]
