# Sequence 3: Mentor of Justice

## Mentor of Justice

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Separate your own evil personality and reach a consensus with it. Through practice or communication, the evil personality recognizes the righteous personality a little bit, and the righteous personality also recognizes the evil personality a little bit. Finally, merge into one and consume **Devil Medicine** [[LINK LATER: Devil Medicine | type=item | hint=Sequence 3 advancement]] (unofficial ceremony).

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Dexterity +1, Inspiration +1, Constitution +1, Charm +2.
- **Skill Gain:** Religion +1 skill level, Occult +1 skill level, Law +1 skill level.

### Holy Sea

- **Effect:** You can accumulate righteous and holy power as **Justice Value** (called “justice,” “sacred value,” or “holy value” in the RAW) and spend it at critical moments to burst out stronger solar path abilities [[LINK LATER: Solar Path | type=pathway | hint=Sun-themed abilities]].
- **Gaining Justice Value:** Each time you eliminate an existence in the dark, depraved, or undead domains, or perform an **act of justice** [[LINK LATER: Act of Justice | type=mechanic | hint=Holy Sea trigger]], you gain Justice Value as follows:
  - Ordinary evil existence: +1.
  - Sequence 9 or Sequence 8 evil existence: +2.
  - Sequence 7 evil existence: +3.
  - Sequence 6 evil existence: +4.
  - Sequence 5 evil existence: +5.
  - Sequence 4 evil existence: +10.
  - Sequence 3 evil existence: +20.
  - Sequence 2 evil existence: +40.
  - Sequence 1 evil existence: +80.
  - Perform an act of justice: +1d8.
- **Maximum Justice Value:** Your maximum Justice Value equals your maximum **Spirituality** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=Resource cap]] (excluding extra Spirituality obtained by special sources). [[UNCLEAR: “excluding the extra spirituality obtained by special” does not clearly define which bonuses are excluded.]]
- **Spending Justice Value:** Your accumulated Justice Value is described as an ocean of light within your body. By consuming Justice Value, you can use the Justice abilities below.
  - **Additional Cost:** Each Justice ability costs 3 points of Spirituality per use. [[UNCLEAR: The “use without consuming justice” clause below does not state whether the 3 Spirituality cost is also waived.]]
- **Free Use (Daily):** If you performed an act of justice that day, you have at most one chance to use a Justice ability without consuming Justice Value; this resets the next day.
  - Sequence 2: The maximum number of chances increases to 3; these chances can be continuously saved until consumed.

### Hide by Light

- **Cost:** 10 Justice Value; 3 Spirituality [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=Resource cost]].
- **Use:** **Swift action** [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=rule | hint=Action types]].
- **Duration:** Maintain an encounter [[LINK LATER: Encounter | type=rule | hint=Time scale]].
- **Effect:** You directly become invisible through precise control of optics. Non-**demigod**-level [[LINK LATER: Demigod | type=term | hint=Power tier]] mystics and monsters can’t see your existence. Even a secret **Master Puppet** [[LINK LATER: Master Puppet | type=term | hint=Puppet Master mechanics]] must be demigod level to detect you, because you hide the thread of the **spirit body** [[LINK LATER: Spirit Body | type=term | hint=Spiritual anatomy]] to a certain extent—*or* they can see you, but the light perception is shifted. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW alternates between “can’t see your existence” and “can see it, but the light perception is shifted.”]]

### Actification

- **Cost:** 20 Justice Value; 3 Spirituality.
- **Use:** Swift action.
- **Trigger:** An impending **non-holy domain** attack [[LINK LATER: Non-Holy Domain | type=term | hint=Domain categories]].
- **Effect:** You nullify the triggering attack, but it must be embodied in reality (material or elemental). It cannot be an intangible, conceptual attack. [[UNCLEAR: The clause about “glimpsing their release process in the invisible realm” is unclear as a requirement vs. an alternative condition.]]
  - After use, the corresponding attack immediately turns into dazzling golden light in mid-air, gathers into an “ocean,” and is purified.
  - When facing ranged artillery, this can directly turn multiple artillery and bullets into light.
  - The radiance immediately purifies surrounding curses and evil influences [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=condition | hint=Unholy effects]].

### Symmetra

- **Cost:** 15 Justice Value; 3 Spirituality.
- **Use:** Swift action.
- **Effect:** Choose one thing that suffers loss. You repair changes in reality that were lost due to improper supernatural means.
  - Example: You can restore stolen distance in a round of action—restoring it to the enemy’s rear—and make the enemy “reach” in front of you in disguise, indirectly shortening the distance between the enemy and you by shortening the distance between the enemy and rear objects. [[UNCLEAR: The distance-restoration example is difficult to parse and may imply contradictory positioning changes.]]
- **Limits:** A swift action can only choose one type and target of restoration. Restoring distance cannot restore other things.
- **Additional Effects:**
  - You can choose a target to restore supernatural powers stolen in previous rounds, up to 1d4+1 at a time.
  - You can restore distorted or defrauded orders, causing them to immediately return to their original systems [[LINK LATER: Distorted Orders | type=mechanic | hint=Defrauded order restoration]].
  - This also purifies curses or unholy influences caused by unjust means, and restores:
    - 1d10 **hit points** [[LINK LATER: Hit Points | type=term | hint=HP]] (if any **unholy damage** [[LINK LATER: Unholy Damage | type=mechanic | hint=Damage type]]) and
    - 1d3 **Sanity** [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term | hint=Mental track]] (if any unholy damage)
    to damage caused by such things.
  - The target you restore is protected for 1 round: evil or stealing behaviors performed on the target again in this round will increase the identification difficulty by 10 points **or** reduce the difficulty of breaking free by 10 points. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear when to apply the +10 “identification difficulty” vs. the -10 “break free” difficulty, and to whom each applies.]]

### Zhengyao Wings

- **Cost:** 15 Justice Value; 3 Spirituality.
- **Use:** **Free action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=rule | hint=Action types]].
- **Limits:**
  - Not subject to the use restriction of Justice abilities; the use restriction is calculated separately. [[UNCLEAR: The “use restriction of justice ability” is referenced but not defined in this section.]]
  - Once per round.
- **Effect:** Once per round, you strengthen the spell effect of your **Sun domain** [[LINK LATER: Sun Domain | type=term | hint=Sun-themed domain]] once. This can be superimposed with **Fire of Light** [[LINK LATER: Fire of Light | type=mechanic | hint=Sun-domain booster]].
  > **Lore:** Two pure white wings spread out on the front of the effect (for example, the **Darkness Spear** [[LINK LATER: Darkness Spear | type=mechanic | hint=Example ability]]), with clustered tips like angels.
- **Bonuses (apply to the strengthened effect):**
  - Offensive solar path abilities: increase damage by 2d10; gain +5 against checks; gain an additional 1d10 damage bonus against darkness, evil, and undead. This additional bonus takes effect only once per use.
  - The effect of enhanced solar power is increased by half.
  - The ability to restore gets double the effect.
  - Radiance-type effects increase range and strength; within the radiance range, everyone gains 1d3 **temporary sanity armor** [[LINK LATER: Temporary Sanity Armor | type=mechanic | hint=Sanity shielding]]. This sanity-armor benefit applies only once per encounter. [[LINK LATER: Radiance | type=mechanic | hint=Effect type]]
