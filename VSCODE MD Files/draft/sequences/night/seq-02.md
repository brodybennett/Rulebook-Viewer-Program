# Sequence 2: Servant of the Concealment

Mastering the secret can make things **secret** and become impossible to **see**. [6]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** To hide a grand event involving at least the [[Angel Personality]], let it happen silently:
  - Without any news being spread.
  - Not being spied on in any way.
  - In the end, you will “disappear” along with the event.
  - > **GM Note:** Marked “unofficial ceremony” in the source text.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** inspiration +2, constitution +1, strength +1, agility +1.
- Choose a skill and set it as [[Proficient]].

### Stealth

**Stealth:** You make a thing “hidden.”

- **Use:** As a free action, once per round, choose one or more targets within your line of sight.
- **Effect:** Stealth can produce the effects below, depending on what you are concealing.

- **Make a person secret:** A person disappears from reality and is transferred to the [[Hidden Kingdom]] of the [[Goddess of the Night]].
  - > **Lore:** Usually an endless dark world with plants such as moon flowers and night herbs. If there was a red moon here before the [[War of Gods]], it was described as “highly illuminated.”
  - This place can be interwoven with the real world, analogous to the [[Spirit World]]. It can be used for teleportation and movement, and can be considered an independent kingdom of God.
  - **Limits within the hidden kingdom:** [[Spiritual Teleportation]] is not available. [[id:alias-divination|Divination]] and [[Wall Penetration]] are still in effect.

- **Conceal a supernatural ability:** Conceal a [[Supernatural Ability]] in front of you to make it disappear.
  - This can be used to avoid damage when a supernatural ability is about to hit you.
  - It must be visible, or you can detect it in some way.
  - It must be hidden in time.
  - You can stealth light and lightning.

- **State stealth (the hidden state):** Turn a person, object, or even event into “invisible.”
  - It can be understood that the target becomes conceptually invisible, disappears, and does not exist. This is the hidden state.
  - This level of authority has absolute priority; it cannot be seen through any channel.
  - They are still in the original position, but they just disappeared.
  - Hiding an event can make the matter no longer be seen by anyone, including via [[Heart]].
  - If you hide someone, you get absolute invisibility in many senses and can walk through obstacles.
    - While you’re invisible this way, you can’t take damage, and you can’t deal damage.

- **Limits:**
  - You cannot directly conceal a person who is the same level as you or higher, but you can conceal that person’s extraordinary power.

- **Anti-secretization:** Remove the secrecy of a thing, including “hiding” that other people want to carry out (e.g., the space hiding of the [[Doorway]], the face covering of the [[Faceless Person]]).
  - It can only act on the macro surface: you can make something that exists in one place but was deliberately hidden become exposed.
  - You cannot pry into the hearts of others this way, or directly know the truth by unlocking the secret of a thing.

- **Extra:** If a target is under your **secretization**, you may extract [[Extraordinary Characteristics]] without a [[Spiritual Imprint]] as if no imprint were present.

- Uncloaking an object means that you have at least included the object in the line of sight, which allows you to directly find any hidden things and secrets around you.
  - In essence, this is to perceive whether a thing or event has signs of being covered up.
  - Therefore, the disguise in the physical sense of the faceless man cannot be exempted from this; you can undo it, but the premise is that you came to his side.

- **When concealment is lifted:** Things concealed by the power of night are still in place. Whatever happens in reality will appear where they were originally concealed when the concealment is lifted, because they are essentially transferred to the hidden realm and do not exist in reality.

- **Sending an area into a hidden country:** The inside and outside of the area are blocked, similar to an independent space.
  - The entire area is plunged into night and stars are twinkling; the stars can also be hidden and not reflected.
  - > **Lore:** Before the plot of [[God of War]], there will be a round of red moon in the sky of the hidden country.
  - To put it simply, the entire area is plunged into darkness, and everything is covered with a dim “veil,” which is no longer real and will not shake naturally due to ordinary wind, as if it has become a “background wall” in the night.
  - However, neither the [[id:alias-error|Error]] nor the [[Audience]] can spy on the information that happened in the hidden country from the outside world; this is true isolation between the inside and the outside.
  - **Exit requirement:** This kind of space that isolates the inside and outside must leave an exit when making it (similar to the hidden space of the doorway). The form of the exit is up to you.
    - Example: You can use the moon in the sky as an escape exit; others must run into the red moon in the sky if they want to go out.
    - The distance between the two will not be as far away as the real earth and the moon.
    - The closed people can leave as long as they touch the closed border towards that side.
  - **Unlocking the hidden kingdom:** The night in the sky can be gradually erased like an eraser, or shattered like glass. The specific form is up to you.
  - **Battle isolation:** No matter what kind of battle occurs in the hidden world, reality will not be affected, and passers-by who are not involved will not enter the hidden world because they are within the combat range.

- In the end, naturally, you can also conceal the extraordinary power that has not completely dissipated.

### Servant of Concealment

- **Use:** After passing a **difficulty 20** inspiration test, you can perceive the surroundings or designate a thing to sense.
- **Effect:** You know whether the other party is hiding something, or whether a thing has a secret.
