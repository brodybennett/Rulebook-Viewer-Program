## Midnight Poet

> **Lore:** Good at fighting, shooting, climbing, and sensing; has high inspiration; uses different styles of poems to produce different effects on surrounding creatures.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Strength** [[Strength]] +1, **Constitution** [[Constitution]] +1, **Dexterity** [[Dexterity]] +1, **Inspiration** [[Inspiration]] +2.
- Your **Fighting** [[Fighting]] / **Shooting** [[Shooting]] / **Climbing** [[Climbing]] skills increase by 1 level. [[Skill level]]

- The skill growth of **Sequence** [[Sequence]] 9 can start to be learned to be erudite, and the number of growth increases in turn. [[Sequence 9]]
[[UNCLEAR: The “skill growth of Sequence 9… learned to be erudite” sentence is not clearly translated, so the exact rule being granted is unclear.]]

### Recite Poems

- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]].
- **Use:** 1 **spell-casting action** [[Spell-Casting Action]]; choose 1 kind of poetry and perform the corresponding chant RP.
- **Targeting and range:** All verses primarily affect only the direction you are facing; creatures who hear the verse are acceptable. Creatures not in the direction you are facing are affected within acceptable limits.
[[UNCLEAR: “Acceptable” and “affected within acceptable limits” are undefined, and the exact targeting beyond the facing direction is unclear.]]
- **Effect:** Choose one verse below; apply its effects to all affected creatures (as defined above). Test difficulties use **Difficulty Value** [[Difficulty Value]] as written.
  1. **Slack Psalm**
     - Affected creatures resist a **Will Test** [[Will Test]] (Difficulty Value 15); otherwise, it continues until the end of your next round of actions.
     - You can perform at most 1 **swift action** [[Swift Action]].
     - **Skill** and **attribute** tests are **disadvantaged** [[Disadvantage]] by -2. [[Attribute Test]]
  2. **Midnight Psalm**
     - All affected creatures fall into a **stupor state** [[stupor state]] for 1 round.
     - Every time they act, you can use a **Will Test** (Difficulty Value 15) to get rid of the stupor.
     - The effect lasts until the end of your next round of action.
     - **Drowsy state** [[Drowsy state]]:
       - Regarded as a **bondage** [[bondage]].
       - Unable to perform actions other than **free actions** [[free actions]].
       - Gains **disadvantage**, and other creatures gain **advantage** [[Advantage]].
       - If any damage or mental influence is suffered, this state is lifted immediately and causes awakening; ordinary creatures fall asleep directly.
[[UNCLEAR: The text uses “stupor state” and separately defines “Drowsy state,” but does not clearly state whether these are the same condition; “ordinary creatures fall asleep directly” is also unclear in timing/trigger.]]
  3. **Requiem Psalm**
     - All affected creatures must undergo a **Will Test** (Difficulty Value 10); otherwise, until the end of your next round, you lose 1 attack/casting/move action (cannot be superimposed).
     - Ordinary **undead** [[Undead]] creatures lose their desire to attack without making a test.
     - **Special:** Requiem removes mental states such as **fear** [[fear]], **anger** [[anger]], **charm** [[charm]], and **temporary madness** [[Temporary Madness]]; excludes other **madness** [[Madness]] and **shock** [[Shock]].
  4. **Intoxicated Poetry**
     - All affected creatures see the dream and resist a **Will Test** (Difficulty Value 15); otherwise, on the premise of maintaining the action, all displacements within 1 round go in a random direction (they cannot distinguish dreams and reality).
     - Carry out a **Lucky Appraisal** [[Lucky Appraisal]] (Difficulty Value 15) to confirm whether it is the desired direction; a **big failure** [[Big Failure]] leads to a dangerous area.
  5. **Praise the Psalm**
     - All affected creatures feel sacredness and pity.
     - **Limit:** Only once every 24 hours.
     - Normal creatures who hear the Psalm recover 1 point of **Sanity** [[Sanity]].
     - **Special:** **Immortal** [[Immortal]], **fallen** [[Fallen]], **dark** [[Dark]], or **polluted** [[polluted]] creatures, or creatures in extraordinary madness and out of control [[out of control]], must immediately make a **Will Test** (Difficulty Value 20).
       - If the test fails, they suffer 0/1 Sanity loss and show obvious discomfort.
[[UNCLEAR: “0/1 Sanity loss” is ambiguous (unclear whether it is optional, random, conditional, or a notation for a specific rule).]]
       - Extraordinary crazy/out-of-control people need to attack the caster immediately or give priority to attack within 1 round; the rest show a little malice.
