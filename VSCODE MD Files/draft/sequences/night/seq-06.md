# Sequence 6: Soul Assurer

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1, Inspiration +2.
- Your occult skills increase by 1 level.

### Requiem

- **Cost:** 1 **Casting Action**; consume 3 **Spirituality Points**.
- **Targeting and range:**
  - Select 1 target within your **Field of Vision**; affect a range of 130 meters; **or**
  - Select all targets within this range; affects all creatures except you indiscriminately.
  - The range of influence can be controlled.
- **Limits:** There is no specific limit to the number of Requiems.
- **Effect:** You appease the soul, smooth out the opponent’s desires and emotions, or put the natural spirit in a relatively peaceful state. The chosen creature suffers the following effects, which cannot be superimposed, and no identification is required:
  1. Mental states such as anger, fear, charm, temporary madness, indeterminate madness, and malice are immediately cleared, and these states will not be generated within 1 round.
     - This does not include shock and awe.
     - This includes stimulants, psychological hints, and the benefits of losing sanity.
     - **Special:** Even if a target that has been permanently insane and out of control undergoes a Requiem, the corresponding madness will reappear after the Requiem ends.
  2. Skill and attribute identification −4 is unfavorable, and 1 attack/casting/movement is lost. This lasts until the end of the **Requiemer**’s next action.  
     [[UNCLEAR: “skill and attribute identification −4 is unfavorable” is not defined (what it applies to and what “unfavorable” means).]]
  3. Ordinary undead creatures (shadows, living corpses, etc.) will immediately lose all attack desires, and lose their activity and turn back to ordinary dead bodies or dissipate.
     - Other than this or higher than 1 undead creatures: mobility halved; damage halved.
     - **Note:** The effect of halving is rounded up. The undead creature transformed from an **Extraordinary** is essentially a living thing and will not suffer from the effect of (3).  
       [[UNCLEAR: “other than this or higher than 1 undead creatures” is ambiguous (which undead qualify and what “higher than 1” refers to).]]
  4. If the Requiem is an ordinary person or other ordinary creatures, it will lose all desires and cannot perform any actions.
     - **Special:** In addition to the effect of (3), the full effect of the target higher than 1 character is halved, and no action will be lost. Only the mental state caused by the extraordinary ability of the higher than 1 character can also only have the effect halved, rounded up, to clear the forced movement effect.  
       [[UNCLEAR: This special rule uses “higher than 1” and “full effect … is halved” without defining the category or which parts of Requiem are halved, and references “forced movement effect” unclearly.]]

> **Lore:** The invisible fluctuations dissipated unsmoothly, and the surrounding suddenly darkened, as if it was late at night, and the feeling of tranquility and serenity came with a little bit of starlight.

### Spiritual Vision

- After reaching the level of **Sequence 6**, your high Inspiration has really enhanced your spiritual vision.
- From now on, you don’t need to activate your spirit vision; you can directly use normal vision to spot [[LINK LATER: spiritual creatures | type=term | hint=creature category visible via spirit/spiritual vision]].
  - This does not include the advanced invisibility of [[LINK LATER: resentful souls | type=term | hint=spiritual entity with advanced invisibility]].
  - This does not include [[LINK LATER: information creatures | type=term | hint=creature category excluded from this vision]].
- (This is the effect brought by 1 potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.)

### Ritual Mastery

- You gain access to ritual magic, able to invoke power from the gods.
- While holding this ability, you gain access to ritual magic, regardless of whether your occult skill is advanced or not.
- For the ritual magic you can use, refer to [[LINK LATER: Common Ritual Magic | type=ritual | hint=ritual magic list referenced by this ability]].
- (This is the effect brought by 1 potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.)
