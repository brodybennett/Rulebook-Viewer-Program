# Darkness Pathway: Sequence 9

## The Sleepless

> **Lore:** The mythical creature associated with this Pathway is an eight-legged magic wolf, corresponding to the Tarot card “Star”.

The favored ones of the night have excellent eyesight even without light. They require only three to four hours of rest per day, and become increasingly energetic as night deepens—growing superior in strength, agility, thinking, and inspiration compared to ordinary people. They can also keenly sense unknown dangers and hidden existences in darkness.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Dexterity +1, Inspiration +1
- **Skills:** Fighting +1 level, Shooting +1 level, Climbing +1 level

Skill mastery and accelerated learning for Fighting/Shooting/Climbing (including sub-skills):

1. If you take an effective, practical course of at least 2 hours, your corresponding skill increases by 1 level.
2. From training → proficiency → advanced:
   - You must learn **2 times** to reach proficiency.
   - You must learn **3 times** to reach advanced.
   - The Sequence 9 potion can only support you up to the advanced level for now; after that, the learning rate cannot obtain a substantial improvement.
3. Learning can only be done once per day. Characters of higher Sequences can use twice the inspiration brought by potions to improve their growth skills.

### Blessed of the Night

**Blessed of the Night:** The deeper the night, the more energetic you are, and your strength, agility, thinking, and inspiration become increasingly superior to ordinary people.

Time-based benefits:

1. **At dusk:** Attribute and skill identification +1 (beneficial).
2. **Night time:**
   - All attributes +1
   - Attribute and skill identification +2 (beneficial)
   - You will only be exhausted due to extraordinary factors.
3. **Late night:**
   - All attributes +2
   - Attribute and skill identification +2 (beneficial)
   - You will only become exhausted due to extraordinary factors.
4. **Quick Dodge (Fast dodge):** At night/late night, have complete physical defense against firearms (light/lightning bypass this); gain 1 extra level of dodge.

Special timing definitions:

- **Late night** refers to **11:00 p.m. to 3:00 a.m.**
- **Night time** refers to all times when it is completely dark **except** late night.
- **Dusk** includes the approaching night and also **indoors with no light during the day**.
  - Shadows under outdoor sunlight do **not** count (their darkness intensity is far less than real night).
  - Dark indoors are regarded as dusk.

Sequence scaling note:

- [[Darkness Pathway Sequence 8]]: Quick Dodge changes from limited (night/late night) to permanent; even if you lose **Blessed of the Night**, it will not disappear.

### No Sleep

**No Sleep:** You only need to rest for three to four hours per day.

1. Resting **3–4 hours** fully restores your spirituality and energy. As long as you are within this interval, whether you rest for the full 4 hours makes no difference.
2. Because you are energetic at night, although you can fall asleep at night, you usually rest during the day.

- Special: This is a potion effect and cannot be recorded or stolen.

Sequence scaling notes:

- [[Darkness Pathway Sequence 8]]-[[Darkness Pathway Sequence 6]]: Rest time is 3h at Sequence 8, then reduces by 1h per Sequence (Sequence 7: 2h; Sequence 6: 1h).
- [[Darkness Pathway Sequence 5]]: It only takes **half an hour** to rest (difference can be **10 minutes**).

### Darkvision

**Darkvision:** Even in a completely dark environment, you can maintain normal vision. This does not mean you can directly ignore extraordinary abilities that hide using shadows or darkness.

### Premonition of Danger

**Premonition of Danger:** You can keenly perceive unknown dangers and unknown existences hidden in darkness.

Whenever you are about to suffer a surprise/sneak attack from within darkness/shadow, you gain the following benefits:

1. Immediately perceive the source of danger in your mind; flashing thoughts tell you the location, source, and form of the danger. You will not be attacked/sneaked by things in the dark/shadow; you are immune to surprise/sneak attacks from darkness at night (treat as always warned).
2. If at night/late night, if one attack can lose half of your maximum blood volume (round up):
   - Perform an Inspiration appraisal at **Difficulty Value 15**.
   - If successful, your physical defense gains a **+4 temporary bonus**; facing Light/Lightning modification to preserve complete physical defense.
3. If the danger’s range is large enough (e.g., a gas explosion across the entire area in an instant), you gain no benefits even if you are alerted.

Sequence scaling notes:

- [[Darkness Pathway Sequence 8]]: The thought no longer flashes through the mind; the corresponding screen flashes instead. On the premise that you don’t dodge, you can see the corresponding result.
- [[Darkness Pathway Sequence 7]]: Your Inspiration identification is successful by default.
- [[Darkness Pathway Sequence 6]]: You can perceive the danger of a person higher than you.

### Vision

**Vision:** You gain vision, but it is not as effective for you as your own inspiration.

Activation:
- **Use:** 1 free action.
- **Cost:** Consuming 1 **spirituality point** per round.
- **Effect:** You activate vision, and your vision gains the following benefits:


1. **Etheric body:** You can roughly tell whether the target’s body is good or bad through aura color, but you can’t get detailed information.
2. **Spiritual body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality; this cannot identify extraordinary people.
3. **Mental body:** You can see whether the target is thinking, but nothing more detailed.
4. **Astral body:** You cannot see the astral body.
5. While in the Spirit Vision state, your spiritual intuition test +1 (beneficial).

Notes:

- Dead creatures are usually dull in color and cannot be identified.
- Spiritual materials are usually spiritual, but you cannot determine the corresponding Pathway.

Sequence scaling notes:

- [[Darkness Pathway Sequence 6]]:
  - Observing the etheric body can directly see spiritual organisms and the physical condition of different parts of the target.
  - When examining a specific organ in detail: the mental body can begin to distinguish the corresponding Pathways of different spiritual materials.
  - The mental body can see the target’s general emotions.
- Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default (not dissipated for 24 hours) and cannot be recorded or stolen.
