# Sequence 7: Nightmare

- You can forcibly pull other people into a dream.
- You can also freely enter and exit the dreams of any sleeping person across a huge range. [[Enter/exit dreams]]
- Forcibly dragging people into dreams has a limited range and usually appears in head-to-head confrontations, but you do **not** need to be face-to-face to attempt it.
- Within 100 meters, this influence takes time and a process and cannot be completed all at once—like coaxing a child to sleep.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility (DEX) +1, Intuition (INT) +2.
- **Skill Gain:** Fighting +1 level, Shooting +1 level, Climbing +1 level.
- The skill growth of Sequence 9 follows the rapid growth rules; cap at **Master**; growth count increases sequentially (2/3/4).

### Forcibly Pull People Into Dreams

- **Use:** 1 Casting Action. Casting Action
- **Cost:** Consume 3 **Spirituality points**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Targeting and range:** Select 1 or more targets within 100 meters and within your field of vision. [[Field of Vision]]
- **Limits:**
  - No more than 10 targets in your field of vision are immediately dreamed.
  - No identification is required.
  - Undead creatures are also affected. [[Undead creatures]]
- **Effect:** Force the selected targets into a dream.

#### Dreaming Rules

1. You can freely weave the content of the dream, but you cannot directly spy on the mind of the dreamed person through the dream. The owner of the dream is still the dreamed person. If you want to obtain information in the dream, you can “guide.” [[Guide (dream)]]
   > **GM Note:** Example of “guide”: create a picture frame in the dream and imply it contains someone’s appearance. If the dreamed person believes it, they will fill in the corresponding appearance with their own mind for you to see.

2. Conversation with the dreamed person in the dream state is similar to reality. In a confused state, unless it involves deep conscious content that makes the subconscious resist speaking, the dreamed person will generally not lie.

3. If the target you want to drag into the dream is not within your field of vision, you can still pull it into the dream:
   - **Use:** 1 Full-Round Action. [[Full-Round Action]]
   - **Range:** Cannot exceed 100 meters.
   - This cannot be done all at once; it takes time and a process (like putting a child to sleep).

4. Usually only in non-combat situations, you can use the Nightmare ability so the dreamer only vaguely remembers what kind of dream they had, but not the specific content—excluding targets who can stay awake in the dream. [[Stay awake in the dream]]
   - If you participate too deeply in the dream, a **Difficulty Value** 25 Intuition (INT) test may remind the dreamer of some clues (not including your appearance, but possibly including your general attire). Intuition Test

**Falling into a dream** is considered a **bound** state (a “bondage state”). [[Bound]]
- External manifestation is close to sleepwalking.
- “Awake” targets have **advantage** on the resistance test against it. [[Advantage / Disadvantage]]

A dreamed target wakes up immediately if it suffers damage or mental influence. [[Mental influence]]
- If there is too much noise in reality, it can immediately make an extra Intuition (INT) test to realize the dream or a Will test to awaken from the dream. Will Test

#### Leaving a Dream

1. In a dream, if the dreamed person actively realizes this is a dream, they can perform a **Difficulty Value** 15 Will test to wake up from the dream every round. Extraordinary ability in the dream generally has no practical effect.

2. Extraordinary people with extraordinary abilities in the dream field stay awake in the dream by default, and may exit immediately as a **free action**.

3. If the Nightmare suffers any damage or mental impact, the dream ends immediately because it cannot be maintained.

4. If the dreamer is not aware of the dream: whenever there is an unreasonable passage in the dream content, the host can let the dreamer realize it with a **Difficulty Value** 15 Intuition (INT) test.

Additional rules:
- If the same creature is dreamed twice within the **same encounter**, it can immediately make a Will test to wake up on the second attempt.
- If the dreamed creature is out of sight and was dragged into a dream with a Full-Round Action, then the difficulty of the two leave/realize checks in this subsection is **-5**. If it is dreamed twice, it also enjoys this benefit; this benefit can be superimposed.

#### Maintaining the Dream State

From the moment you fall into a dream, you can perceive both the dream state and reality to a certain extent. You must also maintain the dream, which brings a large burden and makes it difficult to distinguish dream from reality.

While maintaining the dream state, you suffer the following disadvantages:
- You cannot perform free/attack/casting/move/full-round actions, and you cannot speak; you must be out of the dream state to do so. Free Action Attack Action Move Action
- Although you can perceive reality, the actions you can perform are negligible.
- You can still faintly hear voices in reality.
- You can leave the dream state without any action at any time; doing so causes targets you forced into the dream to wake up immediately.
- You are also considered **bound** while maintaining the dream state, gaining advantage/disadvantage; you may be attacked/surprised. If you recognize the attack in time, you can leave the dream state and react; this is usually not a problem.

> **GM Note:** Playing tip: if you frequently use the Nightmare ability, difficulty distinguishing dreams from reality can cause poor memory. This problem is not completely resolved until Sequence 4.

### Nightmare Transformation

- **Use:** 1 Full-Round Action.
- **Cost:** No Spirituality expenditure.
- **Requirement:** You must fall asleep in reality; your spirit body enters the dream world. [[Spirit body]]

**Dream world:** A world that looks the same as reality, shrouded in mist; the range you can reach is a city. The city in this world is composed of the common cognition of countless dreamers.

In the dream world:
1. You can use Dream Perception to see the location of light clusters. Their positions match the real world: wherever the real dreamer is, the light cluster in the dream is in the dream world.
2. You begin as a spirit body separated from your own body. You can reach the boundary of your dream, fly into the air, leave your dream, and fly into other light clusters representing dreams to enter the corresponding dream.
3. You do not know the content of a dream before entering it. Unlike forced dreaming, to leave a dream entered this way you must actively cross the border of the dream.

#### Other Applications

- With this ability, you can travel through the dream world of an entire city while staying at home.
- In the dream world, you can use your extraordinary abilities as usual, but they have no actual impact.
- Because the premise of being in the dream world is already having entered a dream, you cannot find people who have not entered a dream here, and you cannot force them to enter a dream.
- In a dream:
  - Your blood volume equals your Spirituality. Blood Volume
  - Your **Agility (DEX) (Agility (DEX))** is +2.
  - You can fly.
  - Generally, you don’t enjoy more benefits; unless you have entered someone else’s dream, you can’t realize what you imagined.
  - As a spirit body, you may be overwhelmed by “Layer power capture” (GM-defined hazard).

Special:
- Although your spirit body has entered the dream world, your real spirit body remains with your physical body; the dream spirit body is a projection.

### Dream Perception

- **Use:** 1 Swift Action. Swift Action
- **Effect:** Open Dream Perception to see clusters of illusory oval balls of light that hide or appear, representing the sources of dreams.

Each ball of light represents a dream:
1. The balls of light can be seen through barriers. You can tell whether a creature is asleep—and can also tell if it is not asleep—so this can be used to some extent to detect whether living things exist in a place. [[Living things]]
2. The dreams you perceive allow you to enter them with Invasion Dreams and use Nightmare abilities to guide them. Even if you directly destroy some things in the dreams, the dream owner can no longer manifest them in that dream. [[Invasion Dreams]]
3. The range of dreams you can perceive is the same as the range you can pull into dreams.
