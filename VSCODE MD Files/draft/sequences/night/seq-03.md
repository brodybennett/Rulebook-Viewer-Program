# Sequence 3: Horror Bishop

## Horror Bishop

> **Lore:** The combination of sleep and fear symbolizes danger in the dark—silent destruction, and disappearance.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Create a nightmare that covers the entire night and reaches the entire city, allowing the residents to equate darkness with danger for a long time. *(unofficial ceremony)*  
  [[Nightmare]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +1, Constitution +1, Strength +1, Agility +1, and **Mysticism** increased by one level.  
  [[Mysticism]]

### Control of Darkness

- **Cost:** An attack action consumes 4 points of **Spirituality**.  
  [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** Attack action.
- **Requirement:** Must be used in a dark place. You may also create darkness; doing so costs 12 points of **Spirituality** to use.  
  [[Darkness]]
- **Targeting and direction:** Affects targets in the same direction.
  - Affects at most three targets in that direction.
  - The number of targets below **Demigods** is unlimited.  
    [[Demigod]]
- **Check/defense:** A **Mysticism** attack targets the opponent’s **Physical Defense**.

  [[Physical Defense]]
- **Effect:** Shape darkness into an invisible blade (or any image you want). The darkness around you follows your instructions and directly attacks the opponent’s vitals.
- **Damage:** You deal **5d8+5** damage. This damage does not count as any kind of damage; it comes from endless darkness.
- **Choose one benefit (apply on a hit that causes damage):**
  1. **Vital strike:** Choose a vital strike with no penalty required. As long as you cause damage through this skill, the vital strike effect takes effect directly.  
     [[Vital strike]]
  2. **Fear:** Inflict a **Frightened** state for three rounds. If the target’s **Sequence** level is lower than yours, it lasts for the entire encounter and for a period afterward, until they think they are safe.  
     [[Frightened]]  
     [[Sequence]]
  3. **Dreaming:** Release the dreaming effect at the same time, but only the target you hit will fall into the dream after it is judged that the hit has caused damage. This does not trigger the awakening of the damaged one.

     [[Awakening]]
  4. **Unavoidable darkness (alternate damage):** Your damage becomes **3d8+5**. Choose one of the above three benefits to take effect, but your attack does not need to be identified this time; the darkness in all directions is completely unavoidable. You directly cause damage and gain the chosen benefit. **Substitute** is allowed but consumes three substitutes, and the target still suffers **1d8+5** damage for each substitute that is insufficient.  
     - (Incremental bonus of **1d8**. Choosing vital strike cannot increase damage, but still gives negative effects other than damage in the case of insufficient substitutes.)  
     [[Substitute]]  
     [[UNCLEAR: Option 4 uses undefined terms (“identified,” “Substitute,” “incremental bonus of 1d8”) and the exact interaction between substitutes, remaining damage (1d8+5 per insufficiency), and the parenthetical note is not fully specified.]]
- **Avoidance:** Long-distance displacement skills of **Spirit World Shuttle** can still avoid the damage, including the **Flash of the Moon** of the **Moon Pathway**.

  [[Moon Pathway]]  
  [[Flash of the Moon]]
- **Synergy:** If the target of your attack is already **Frightened**, you have a +5 bonus on subsequent **Occult checks** against them.  
  [[Occult check]]
- **Extra:** You can use the darkness around you to fly at twice your speed of movement, and you don’t necessarily need a **spirit body**.  
  [[Spirit body]]
- **Sequence 1 upgrade:** You receive an additional Strength damage die for this ability.
