# Door Pathway: Sequence 0

## Door

- You can open or close all things related to the concept of “door” in the whole world, allowing a seal to be broken or strengthened within a certain period of time.
- You can create a space cage out of thin air.
- You can degenerate and destroy space, causing the target to collapse and be destroyed with the surrounding void, then be swallowed by darkness.

- **Uniqueness:** A pair of eyeballs that seem to be composed of pure starlight, containing layers of illusory doors.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual (unofficial ceremony):** Allow yourself to break through the god level, the seal of **Sequence 0** level, and open the door of the seal belonging to **Sequence 0**.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** inspiration +2; pilot skill increased by 2 skill levels.

### Conceptualization

- **Use:** **Free Action**
- **Effect:** The **Planeswalker** ability of **Sequence 0** undergoes a qualitative change. You can become a **conceptual creature**: your figure becomes distorted, instantly stained with bright starlight, and extremely illusory—as if turning into a star gate—no longer like a physical creature, but closer to an aggregate of symbols such as “roaming,” “star passage,” “key,” and “gate.”
- **Limits:** In the conceptual creature state, you completely ignore any physical damage.

### Void Collapse

- **Cost:** 50 points of **Spirituality**
- **Use:** **Spellcasting Action**
- **Targeting and range:** Select an area.
- **Limits:** Only has two encounters in one **Encounter**. [[UNCLEAR: “only has two encounters in one encounter” is grammatically self-contradictory and the intended usage limit cannot be determined.]]
- **Effect:** You make space collapse and annihilate into nothingness. This is almost a death-level ability; even if the target is **Sequence 0** of the [[Path of the Fool]], they must lose all their [[substitutes]] and, at the cost of being unable to maintain further survival, can barely avoid this blow.

### Divine Gaze
- **Use:** When any creature recites your **True Name**.
- **Effect:** You can gaze at the surroundings of that creature, and use your extraordinary abilities to target the area at will.
