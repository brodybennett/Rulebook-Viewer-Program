# Sequence 4: Mystic

## Mystic

> **Lore:** You possess a “secret-keeping” talent, can perform **Space Hiding** and **Spatial Exile**, and use various **Doors** as defenses.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** The ascendant must seal a demigod-level creature with clear hostility. The less external force is used, the better the ritual’s effect. As for the target’s personality, as long as it is not lower than a demigod, it is fine, and it will not in essence influence the ritual. [[UNCLEAR: The clause about the target’s “personality” being “not lower than a demigod” is unclear in meaning/criteria.]]

### Special Characteristic Appearance

- **Special Characteristic (Appearance):** A crystal ball made of insects. [[LINK LATER: Crystal Ball | type=item | hint=used as a tool/focus in this sequence]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +2. [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute]]
- Your navigating skills increase by 2 skill levels. [[LINK LATER: Navigating Skills | type=term | hint=skill system term]]
- Choose three training abilities to become proficient. [[LINK LATER: Training Ability | type=term | hint=skill/feature category]] [[LINK LATER: Proficient | type=term | hint=skill rank]]
- Choose three more skills for training. [[LINK LATER: Skill Training | type=mechanic | hint=training selection rules]]
- Two originally proficient skills can be upgraded to advanced. [[LINK LATER: Advanced | type=term | hint=skill rank]]

### Keeping Secrets

- **Use:** Passive.
- **Effect:** You can keep secrets, shielding induction, detection, divination, prophecy, and spiritual intuition from a person no higher than you; these are no longer useful against you. [[LINK LATER: Induction | type=mechanic | hint=sensing/induction effect]] [[LINK LATER: Detection | type=mechanic | hint=information-gathering]] [[LINK LATER: Divination | type=mechanic | hint=information-gathering]] [[LINK LATER: Prophecy | type=mechanic | hint=information-gathering]] [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition | type=mechanic | hint=information-gathering]]
- They may know your existence indirectly, but they can no longer know other information about you; your actions are usually not directly targeted by scrying. [[LINK LATER: Scrying | type=mechanic | hint=remote viewing/targeting]]
- Even for detection or prophecy higher than your level: if you do not reveal the kept secret at a certain moment and do not leave divination or prophecy clues, angel or higher-level detection usually cannot directly obtain effective information by divining “what are you hiding.” [[LINK LATER: Angel | type=term | hint=power tier above demigod]] [[LINK LATER: Divination Clue | type=mechanic | hint=what counts as a clue is defined elsewhere]]
- **Limits:** This does not include your teammates. If someone else is involved in an event, you still have to smash a crystal ball and do a counter-scry with both you and them present. [[LINK LATER: Teammate | type=term | hint=party member]] [[LINK LATER: Counter-Scry | type=mechanic | hint=opposes scrying; procedure not defined here]] [[UNCLEAR: “Smash a crystal ball” and the exact procedure/effects of “counter-scry” are not defined here.]]

### Gate to Another World

- **Use:** At will.
- **Use (Action):** **Full-Round Action**. [[LINK LATER: Full-Round Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy term]]
- **Effect:** Create a **Door** to any location you know, up to the planet, and you can let creatures enter or return from the door. [[LINK LATER: Door | type=mechanic | hint=created gateway object]] [[UNCLEAR: “Up to the planet” is ambiguous as a range/limit (e.g., within a planet vs. planetary scale).]]
- **Duration:** The door remains permanent until you use [[LINK LATER: Dissolve | type=mechanic | hint=ends a door as a free action]] as a **Free Action**. [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy term]]
- **Access/Opening:** A successful [[LINK LATER: Navigator Identification | type=mechanic | hint=skill check to open the correct door]] is usually required to open the correct door.
- **Special:** You can now travel to places like [[LINK LATER: Mirror World | type=location | hint=alternate realm accessible via doors]].
- **Sequence 2:** The scope includes all the places in the universe you have been to.

### Illusion

- **Cost:** 10 points of **Spirituality**. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource; RAW also calls this “spiritual points”]]
- **Use (Action):** **Free Action**.
- **Effect:** You become a gate of illusion: the main body appears behind the “gate,” and the attacker is in two different worlds, facing you from far away. [[LINK LATER: Illusory Gate | type=mechanic | hint=this defensive door state]]
- You immediately create an independent door in front of you (covered with mysterious patterns) that lasts for an encounter. [[LINK LATER: Encounter | type=mechanic | hint=scene/initiative duration]]
- After creating the illusory door, you are directly separated into the independent space inside the door. This space can only be accessed through the door or by breaking the door.
- While in the separate space, you cannot travel through the [[LINK LATER: Spirit World | type=location | hint=travel realm referenced elsewhere]], but you can disarm the door at any time as a **Free Action**.
- **Substitute Use (Trigger):** This ability can be used the moment you are successfully attacked by an attack. The created door can immediately take damage for you. The attack is considered successful and does not need to be checked again against the door. Only such immediate use is considered a substitute use. [[UNCLEAR: The phrase “checked again against the door” implies a separate confrontation/check that is not fully specified here.]]
- **Door Statistics:** Doors have 40 **Health** and 25 **Defense**. [[LINK LATER: Health | type=term | hint=HP of objects]] [[LINK LATER: Defense | type=term | hint=defensive stat]]
- **Stacking Doors:** If there is already a door, doors can be duplicated. You can stack another door after one door, layer by layer. If the damage suffered by the previous door exceeds its upper limit, the excess damage is borne by the next door.
- If the last door is damaged, overflow damage from the last door is resolved against your own physical defense, and you do not enjoy bonuses from agility and dodge. [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=term | hint=defense type]] [[LINK LATER: Agility | type=term | hint=stat/bonus source]] [[LINK LATER: Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=evasion bonus source]]
- If the enemy fails in the confrontation, it is considered that the door has almost no power due to the weakening of the door. [[UNCLEAR: “Fails in the confrontation” is unclear (which roll/check and against what target number).]]
- **Limits:** This door can only accommodate you alone. While inside the door, you are not considered a target within the range of vision.

### Space Hiding

- **Effect (Concept):** Grabbing the void with the right hand can distort a space area, cut it into two parts, and hide one part. The only way to get out of the hidden space is through the door or by unhiding it. This can be used to create space pockets. [[LINK LATER: Space Pocket | type=mechanic | hint=portable storage variant described below]]
- **Use (Action):** **Casting Action**. [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy term]]
- **Cost:** 5 points of **Spirituality**.
- **Effect:** Hide a piece of space in the current range; there must be a door to leave.
- **Door Statistics (Typical):** This door usually has 25 **Defense** and 40 **Health**.
- **Camouflage:** You can camouflage the door to look the way you like, but it must be different from the wall; you can also cover it with something.
- **What Counts as a Door:** A door does not have to be a long door; it is a conspicuous entrance/exit. It cannot be as small as an ant, but it can be window-sized. You can directly enter it when you touch it.
- **Leaving Hidden Space:** Even a mystic must pass through a door to leave a hidden space, or unhide as a **Free Action**.
- **Limits:** Generally, you can’t stack another hidden space inside a hidden space, and you can’t directly travel to the outside world while in a hidden space; you can only travel inside.
- **Visibility/Discovery:** From the outside world, the hidden area disappears out of thin air. For example, if a 50-square-meter house has 3 square meters hidden, then in others’ eyes it is directly missing 3 square meters. Therefore, to hide, you must choose a sufficiently hidden location to avoid discovery.
- **Observation:** You can use a crystal ball or a mirror to observe the situation outside the hidden space through astrology. As much as you can see from here when the space is not hidden, you can see as much when it is hidden. For example, if you hide part of a room, you can only see the inside of the room in the hidden space, but not the outside. [[LINK LATER: Astrology | type=mechanic | hint=divination/observation technique]] [[LINK LATER: Mirror | type=item | hint=tool for observation]]
- **Sequence 2:** You can connect multiple hidden spaces together. They are not surrounded by one layer, but connected by one layer; the former is like a Russian nesting doll, while the latter is like a puzzle pieced together in different spaces, and the health is independent of each other. [[UNCLEAR: “Health is independent” likely refers to each connecting door/space having separate durability, but the exact object(s) with health is not specified.]]

> **GM Note:** Space Hiding can be treated as turning half a structure into an “inner world” and the other half into an “outer world.” Entering the inner world from the outside requires passing through one of the structure’s doors (which may be disguised as a secret door). This can create secret bases or hidden rooms in downtime, but the hidden space cannot be taken
