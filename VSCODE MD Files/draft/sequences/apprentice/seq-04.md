### Keeping Secrets

- **Use:** Passive.
- **Effect:** You can keep secrets, shielding induction, detection, divination, prophecy, and spiritual intuition from a person no higher than you; these are no longer useful against you. [[Induction]] [[Detection]] [[id:alias-divination|Divination]] [[id:alias-prophecy|Prophecy]] [[Spiritual Intuition]]
- They may know your existence indirectly, but they can no longer know other information about you; your actions are usually not directly targeted by scrying. [[Scrying]]
- Even for detection or prophecy higher than your level: if you do not reveal the kept secret at a certain moment and do not leave divination or prophecy clues, angel or higher-level detection usually cannot directly obtain effective information by divining “what are you hiding.” [[Angel]] [[Divination Clue]]
- **Counter-scry:** The GM determines the procedure/effects (smashing a crystal ball is one possible method).

### Gate to Another World

- **Use:** At will.
- **Use (Action):** **Full-Round Action**. [[Full-Round Action]]
- **Range:** Up to planetary scale (GM decides campaign-appropriate limits).
- **Duration:** The door remains permanent until you use [[Dissolve]] as a **Free Action**. [[Free Action]]
- **Access/Opening:** A successful [[Navigator Identification]] is usually required to open the correct door.
- **Special:** You can now travel to places like [[Mirror World]].
- **Sequence 2:** The scope includes all the places in the universe you have been to.

### Illusion

- **Cost:** 10 points of **Spirituality**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Use (Action):** **Free Action**.
- **Effect:** You become a gate of illusion: the main body appears behind the “gate,” and the attacker is in two different worlds, facing you from far away. [[Illusory Gate]]
- You immediately create an independent door in front of you (covered with mysterious patterns) that lasts for an encounter. [[Encounter]]
- After creating the illusory door, you are directly separated into the independent space inside the door. This space can only be accessed through the door or by breaking the door.
- While in the separate space, you cannot travel through the [[Spirit World]], but you can disarm the door at any time as a **Free Action**.
- **Follow-up:** Make the same check as the initial door contest.
- **Door Statistics:** Doors have 40 **Health** and 25 **Defense**. [[Health]] [[Defense]]
- **Stacking Doors:** If there is already a door, doors can be duplicated. You can stack another door after one door, layer by layer. If the damage suffered by the previous door exceeds its upper limit, the excess damage is borne by the next door.
- If the last door is damaged, overflow damage from the last door is resolved against your own physical defense, and you do not enjoy bonuses from agility and dodge. [[Physical Defense]] [[Agility]] [[Dodge]]
- **Failure:** The GM decides the failure outcome.
- **Limits:** This door can only accommodate you alone. While inside the door, you are not considered a target within the range of vision.

### Space Hiding

- **Effect (Concept):** Grabbing the void with the right hand can distort a space area, cut it into two parts, and hide one part. The only way to get out of the hidden space is through the door or by unhiding it. This can be used to create space pockets. [[Space Pocket]]
- **Use (Action):** **Casting Action**. [[Casting Action]]
- **Cost:** 5 points of **Spirituality**.
- **Effect:** Hide a piece of space in the current range; there must be a door to leave.
- **Door Statistics (Typical):** This door usually has 25 **Defense** and 40 **Health**.
- **Camouflage:** You can camouflage the door to look the way you like, but it must be different from the wall; you can also cover it with something.
- **What Counts as a Door:** A door does not have to be a long door; it is a conspicuous entrance/exit. It cannot be as small as an ant, but it can be window-sized. You can directly enter it when you touch it.
- **Leaving Hidden Space:** Even a mystic must pass through a door to leave a hidden space, or unhide as a **Free Action**.
- **Limits:** Generally, you can’t stack another hidden space inside a hidden space, and you can’t directly travel to the outside world while in a hidden space; you can only travel inside.
- **Visibility/Discovery:** From the outside world, the hidden area disappears out of thin air. For example, if a 50-square-meter house has 3 square meters hidden, then in others’ eyes it is directly missing 3 square meters. Therefore, to hide, you must choose a sufficiently hidden location to avoid discovery.
- **Observation:** You can use a crystal ball or a mirror to observe the situation outside the hidden space through astrology. As much as you can see from here when the space is not hidden, you can see as much when it is hidden. For example, if you hide part of a room, you can only see the inside of the room in the hidden space, but not the outside. [[Astrology]] [[Mirror]]
- **Durability:** Connected doors/spaces share a single HP pool.

> **GM Note:** Space Hiding can be treated as turning half a structure into an “inner world” and the other half into an “outer world.” Entering the inner world from the outside requires passing through one of the structure’s doors (which may be disguised as a secret door). This can create secret bases or hidden rooms in downtime, but the hidden space cannot be taken
