# Sequence 5: Traveler

## Traveler

- **Traveler's Gate:** Travel through the **Spirit World** while sensing the outside world and self-positioning; can also perform short-distance continuous flashing to create a “siege” effect by one person. [[Spirit World]]
- **Invisible Hand:** Capable of taking pictures from a distance.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Set up special coordinates in four completely different places far apart in the depths of the **Spirit World**. [[Spirit World]]
- **Function:** After taking the magic potion, you will start to wander in the **Spirit World** uncontrollably. When you initially master the power, you will find that you have lost your way. At this time, you can use the four special coordinates to return to the real world.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +2.
- Your navigating skill increases by 2 skill levels.

### Traveler's Gate

**Traveler's Gate** is also referred to as the “Gate of Teleportation.” It enables teleportation/travel as a self-positioning **Spirit World** shuttle that can sense the outside world. [[Spirit World]]

This ability can be used in two ways:

1) **Long-distance Spirit World travel**
   - **Use:** One **casting action**.
   - **Cost:** 3 points of **spirituality**.
   - **Effect:**
     - You can travel long distances in the **Spirit World**, and you can always sense the reality of the outside world while in the **Spirit World**.
     - You can transmit up to “inspiration + will + half constitution (rounded up)” km.
     - You can also use this to directly enter the **Spirit World**.
   - **Reference:** For the **Spirit World**, please refer to “Chapter Twelve: Special Areas”. [[Chapter Twelve: Special Areas]]

2) **Short-distance continuous flashing**
   - **Use:** 1 **swift action**, up to 12 times in one round. Its priority is regarded as a **free action**. The swift action is the sum of 12 flashes; less than 12 times still occupy a swift.
   - **Effect:** You perform short-distance continuous flashing (no more than 6 meters), which not only allows you to avoid attacks, but also allows you to create a siege effect by yourself, and gain the following benefits:
     - As long as you keep flashing and outflanking the enemy, you and your allies will continue to get the special action effect of enveloping/flanking; that is, you will gain an advantage throughout the process, and the enemy will gain a disadvantage—excluding situations where the enemy is higher than 1 character, and the enemy also has travelers. [[enveloping/flanking]] [[UNCLEAR: “higher than 1 character” and “enemy also has travelers” are not defined clearly enough to determine the exact exclusion condition.]]
     - Any **Extraordinary Ability** that targets you cannot hit you, including abilities that do not require identification—excluding area attacks, light, and lightning; but you retain the agility and evasion of the full physical defense against them.
     - Under the premise of the second article, if you maintain the flashing state and trigger **Premonition of Danger**, the original physical defense of **Premonition of Danger** against light and lightning can be replaced by a temporary +4 effect of physical defense. [[id:alias-premonition-of-danger|Premonition of Danger]]
     - If there is a situation where your 12 flashes in one round are consumed, it will be considered that the attacks have become so dense that you cannot dodge them, and you will be hit, because only 6 seconds have actually passed in one round.
     - If the number of times is used up, you can no longer get any of the above effects.

### Invisible Hand

- **Cost:** Consuming 1 **spirit** per round. [[UNCLEAR: RAW uses both “spirituality” and “spirit” as costs without clarifying whether they are the same resource.]]
- **Effect:**
  - You can take pictures from a distance.
  - You are considered to be able to capture objects at any position equal to the range of **Inspiration**, perform attack actions, or perform abilities that require physical contact (such as opening doors).
  - How much **Inspiration** you have represents how much your invisible hand can dabble.
- **Special:**
  - The invisible hand does not lose health.
  - It has a Strength attribute equal to your Strength.
  - It cannot work outside of line of sight.

### Records

- **Effect:** The number and strength of **Extraordinary Abilities** you can record have been increased. [[recording extraordinary abilities]]
- **From now on, you can record:**
  - 4 Sequence 4-3 abilities
  - 15 Sequence 6-5 abilities
  - 30 Sequence 9-7 abilities
- The effects of Sequence 4-3 abilities will no longer be halved.
