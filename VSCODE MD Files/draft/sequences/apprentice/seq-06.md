# Sequence 6

## Recorder

> **Lore:** The mutated “brain” reproduces the extraordinary ability used by the target, and then drives the activated part of the cells to form the corresponding symbols, patterns, and logos to complete the storage. Let the spirit be the pen and the spirit body be the paper: “I come, I see, I record.”

- You can record extraordinary abilities **with divine influence**.
- The higher the Sequence, the higher the probability of failure. Even at Sequence 4, it may not succeed once in a dozen attempts.
- Recorded ability effectiveness (vs. the original):
  - Recorded extraordinary abilities of Sequence 6 and Sequence 5 are **half** of the original.
  - Recorded extraordinary abilities of Sequence 9 are **close** to the original.

## Advancement

### Main Materials

- A complete [[LINK LATER: Asman | type=other | hint=proper name; source of “brain” material]]
- [[LINK LATER: Cursed Object | type=item | hint=“cursed object of the ancient wraith”]] of the [[LINK LATER: Ancient Wraith | type=faction | hint=entity referenced as “ancient wraith”]]

## Acting Rules

- Record various extraordinary abilities and the scenery and folk customs of various places.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute]] +2
- Your [[LINK LATER: Occult | type=term | hint=skill/ability]] can be quickly upgraded to [[LINK LATER: Proficient | type=term | hint=rank/skill tier]].

### Record

Your mutated “brain” reproduces an extraordinary ability used by a target and constructs a corresponding pattern for storage.

- **Use:** 1 **free action**, whenever you witness an active extraordinary ability, you can immediately record it.
- **Check:** Recording an Extraordinary Ability is an [[LINK LATER: Inspiration Appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=check type]] with an initial difficulty of **20**.
  - ① Every time your recording ability increases by 1 Sequence: identification difficulty **+5**.
  - ② The ability to record is increased by 1 character: identification difficulty **+5**. [[UNCLEAR: “character” is not defined (rank/level/attribute?)]]
  - ③ The ability to record is equal to your level: the difficulty of the initial 20 appraisals remains unchanged. [[UNCLEAR: “level” is not defined (Sequence? character level?)]]
  - ④ The ability to record is reduced by 1 Sequence: identification difficulty **-5**.
  - ⑤ Every time your record ability is lowered by 1 character: the difficulty of identification **-5**, until the default is successful. [[UNCLEAR: “default is successful” condition is not defined]]
- **Special:** Ability records higher than two of yours fail by default, or the probability is extremely low to almost none. [[UNCLEAR: “higher than two of yours” is ambiguous without a defined comparison method]]
- **On success:** This extraordinary ability is considered owned by you as a **one-time ability**; it disappears after being used.

#### Casting a Recorded Extraordinary Ability

The following rules must be followed to cast a Recorded Extraordinary Ability:

1. ① Summon an illusory book in front of you. Each extraordinary ability corresponds to one page. Read: “I came, I saw, I recorded.”
2. ② When using the ability, you must use the action the ability originally required. You must also pay **1 additional swift action** to cast it; flipping through pages is a **free action**.
3. ③ If you roleplay in advance, inform your **GM** of the ability you plan to use next and prepare in advance; as long as it is within your prediction range, the ability you prepared in advance does not need to pay extra free actions.
4. ④ No matter what identification this ability used to be, you can only cast it with [[LINK LATER: Mystical Identification | type=mechanic | hint=identification/check type]]. If it involves strength damage dice, your [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute]] value should be treated as strength. [[UNCLEAR: “identification this ability used to be” is not defined (what categories exist?)]]
5. ⑤ The recorded ability is definitely not as good as the original version, but even if the ability below your level is not as good as the original version, this gap is negligible. When you first promoted, your recorded Sequence 6–5 ability and Sequence 4–3 ability will be cut in half. [[UNCLEAR: “when you first promoted” duration/endpoint is not defined]]

#### Record Capacity

- The number of abilities you can record is as follows:
  - [[LINK LATER: Potion Undigested | type=mechanic | hint=potion digestion state]]: 1 Sequence 4–3 ability, 8 Sequence 6–5 abilities, 20 Sequence 9–7 abilities.
  - [[LINK LATER: Potion Digestion Progress | type=mechanic | hint=progress metric]] 15: 2 Sequence 4–3 abilities, 9 Sequence 6–5 abilities, 22 Sequence 9–7 abilities.
  - [[LINK LATER: Complete Potion Digestion | type=mechanic | hint=fully digested state]]: 3 Sequence 4–3 abilities, 10 Sequence 6–5 abilities, 25 Sequence 9–7 abilities.
- **Special:** When the potion is fully digested, the recorded Sequence 6–5 abilities will no longer be halved.
