# Sequence 3: Wanderer

> **Lore:** You can roam the starry sky.  
> **Lore:** “So far, your journey has set foot on the stars”

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Requirement:** The ritual must be completed in at least **75%** of relevant places.

> **GM Note:** The source labels this as an “unofficial ceremony.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** inspiration +2, charisma +2, education +1, pilot skill increased by 2 skill levels.

### Freedom of Action

- **Effect:** No effect can imprison the Wanderer.
- **Effect:** You are immune to bondage, binding, and all adverse effects of the environment on you.
- **Limits:** The [[Spiritual Body Thread]] has no effect on reducing your movements, but it can still turn you into a [[Secret Puppet]].
- **Limits:** The [[Judge]] and the [[Black Emperor]] cannot restrain your actions.

### Tolerate the Environment

- **Effect:** There is no environment that you cannot adapt to.
- **Effect:** You are immune to any damage caused by the environment, which can make the harsh environment of various planets no longer have a significant impact on you.

### Symbol Positioning

- **Effect:** You obtain an extraordinary symbol. Whoever outlines this symbol or writes it on the ground, you can use a **free action** to observe, detect, or perceive everything around this symbol.
- **Use:** This is actively triggered and cannot be passively sensed.
- **Limits:** You can only sense the change at the moment when the symbol appears or the symbol is destroyed: you notice that someone has drawn the corresponding symbol, or the corresponding symbol disappears—nothing else.
- **Limits:** If you put the symbol in a territory that is not under your control, it may cause detection of you by an equal or higher level without concealment.
- **Effect:** As long as the symbol exists in a certain location, the location of the symbol is considered to be a coordinate in the [[spirit world]] or [[astral world]]. You can sense the specific location and travel long distances to get there as a **Casting Action**.
- **Limits:** The initial isolation of the spirit world may lead to the invalidation of this symbol. But because the spirit world cannot be completely isolated, its vague connection with you still exists.

### Fly

- **Effect:** You gain the ability to fly, allowing you to perform supersonic flawless flight.

### Teleportation (Astral Shuttle)

- **Effect:** Your teleportation ability is greatly enhanced, and you can even use [[astral teleportation]] to travel to other starry skies and planets.
