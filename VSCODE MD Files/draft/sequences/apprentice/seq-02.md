### Concept Travel

```yaml ability
id: apprentice-seq-02-concept-travel
name: Concept Travel
pathway: apprentice
sequence: 2
type: active
action: full-round
cost: {}
roll: null
opposed_by: none
range: self
target: self
duration: sustained

text: 'Use: 1 time per round; Full-Round Action. Effect: You can go to any area and
  time where there is a concept related to you. Limits: This effect cannot be used
  to change history. History altered by you creates another time period parallel to
  the real world without meaningfully affecting the "now". At higher Sequences: [[id:alias-sequence-1|Sequence
  1]]: a spellcasting action. [[Sequence 0]]: a free action.'
```




- **Use:** 1 time per round; Full-Round Action.
- **Effect:** You can go to any area and time where there is a concept related to you.
- **Limits:**
  - This effect cannot be used to change history.
  - History altered by you creates another time period parallel to the real world without meaningfully affecting the "now".
- **At higher Sequences:**
  - [[id:alias-sequence-1|Sequence 1]]: a spellcasting action.
  - [[Sequence 0]]: a free action.

### Space Swap

```yaml ability
id: apprentice-seq-02-space-swap
name: Space Swap
pathway: apprentice
sequence: 2
type: active
action: cast
cost: {}
roll: null
opposed_by: none
range: self
target: designated target(s)
duration: instant
scaling: []
tags:
- ritual
text: 'Cost: A Casting Action that consumes 10 spiritual points. Effect: You exchange
  two spaces. Targeting and range: Each selected space has a radius of no more than
  one kilometer. The distance between the two spaces cannot exceed a country. Limits:
  You must know the exact location and not be hindered by others. The core area of
  a church or an organization usually has a specific shelter and cannot be exchanged.'
```




- **Cost:** A Casting Action that consumes 10 spiritual points.
- **Effect:** You exchange two spaces.
- **Targeting and range:**
  - Each selected space has a radius of no more than one kilometer.
  - The distance between the two spaces cannot exceed a country.
- **Limits:**
  - You must know the exact location and not be hindered by others.
  - The core area of a church or an organization usually has a specific shelter and cannot be exchanged.
  - This ability usually cannot be used precisely on a single creature, because the creature does not always maintain the same posture or exactly the same position. If you want to swap creatures, you must do the swap with the surrounding space.
  - If you have not been to a location to be swapped and are only told a general orientation (rather than specific coordinates of the [[Spirit World]] or [[Astral World]]), the swap may be wrong.
- **Aftereffects:** After use, the spaces are exchanged (e.g., a room can appear in a grassland, and the original location of the room becomes a grassland of the same size).

### To Reproduce

text: 'Effect: Your records no longer have limits. Use and cost: A spellcasting action
  consumes the corresponding spirituality to directly reproduce a supernatural ability
  or scene you have recorded. Recording requirement: You still need a successful [[Writing
  Appraisal]] to record the ability at this stage. Special (angel-level): Two recording
  options exist; the GM decides which applies. Notes: Note: There is no limit to the
  number of reappearances. In theory, as long as you have seen it, you can reappear
  it. However, without understanding the principle, the reproduced ability is usually
  very weak; you still need to conduct a writing appraisal when you see it. Note:
  If you did not pass the writ...'
```




- **Effect:** Your records no longer have limits.
- **Use and cost:** A spellcasting action consumes the corresponding spirituality to directly reproduce a supernatural ability or scene you have recorded.
- **Recording requirement:** You still need a successful [[Writing Appraisal]] to record the ability at this stage.
- **Special (angel-level):** Two recording options exist; the GM decides which applies.
- **Notes:**
  - **Note:** There is no limit to the number of reappearances. In theory, as long as you have seen it, you can reappear it. However, without understanding the principle, the reproduced ability is usually very weak; you still need to conduct a writing appraisal when you see it.
  - **Note:** If you did not pass the writing appraisal at that time, you can directly reproduce the content you have seen later, but you cannot make up the writing appraisal of past things. Content that had not undergone the writing appraisal at that time has half the effect by default.

- **Difficulty Value 25:** You record an angel-level ability, but the recorded ability is not as good as the original version; the effect is half of the original version, but the priority in confrontation is greater than the simulation ability of the [[White Tower]].
- **Note:** The actual calculation does not need to distinguish physical vs spiritual resistance.
- **Difficulty Value 35:** If you record a [[King of Angels]] ability, its power is usually only half, unless you find a [[id:alias-sequence-1|Sequence 1]] [[Angel]] with at least the corresponding Pathway to explore the principle in depth, or learn about it in other ways.
  - **The King of Angels:** If you become the King of Angels, you can record the ability of [[Sequence 0]]; it also only has half the effect, and this half effect cannot be offset by understanding the principle.
  - **Note:** The reason the King of Angels class is divided separately is that you can enjoy the corresponding [[Extra: Personality Suppression]]. In other words, when using a King of Angels level ability, only when attacking, it is judged as an attack by a King of Angels level person.
  - **Note:** When recording angelic abilities, you don't get the Charisma bonus from [[Extraordinary Items]] to your writing skill, but you do get the writing ability bonus, if any.

- **Re-use:** The abilities you have recorded can be re-used anytime, anywhere just like your own abilities, and the reappearance of half-recorded abilities has half the effect.
- **Reproducing people or objects:**
  - You can reproduce specific people or specific scenes; the Difficulty Value to use is equal to the options above.
  - You only need to see the corresponding person or object to reproduce it, but they can only exist for a moment, and you can only launch one attack.
  - If you don't know the person or object deeply enough, the power of the reproduction is only half.
- **Reproducing scenes:**
  - You can reproduce the corresponding scene. The scene is extremely realistic; if you know enough, it is close to reality.
  - Otherwise, all things in the scene have half the effect.
  - The reproduction of the scene lasts at most 2 rounds.

> **GM Note:** If you have an opportunity to communicate with a high-sequence powerhouse whose recorded ability and Pathway match an ability you have (or have had) recorded, using the half-power version in that communication may allow deeper study toward approaching the full angel ability.

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
