# Wheel of Fortune Pathway: Sequence 1

## Snake of Mercury

Also known as the “Snake of Destiny.” The tail-swallowing snake of fate can **restart** a cycle and reverse into an embryo when it encounters an inescapable danger.

- Each restart washes away **madness**, but maintaining the Mercury Serpent state still requires a certain **belief orientation**. Otherwise, it cannot be maintained for too long.
- It can trap people in a cycle of the same fate and, by “restarting,” make an enemy’s time appear to turn back.
- A peculiarity that can conceal one’s own destiny.

When encountering a danger that is difficult to get rid of, the cycle can be restarted and reversed into an embryo. Each time you start over, try to make yourself a little different to maintain a good mental state, and you should look like a child when you are a child.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Let the torrent of your own destiny be connected end to end, from the end of your own destiny to the beginning of your own destiny, and let the upcoming future become a “cycle” of your past destiny. *(unofficial ceremony)*

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Intuition (INT) +6, Luck +6.

Also known as the restart of destiny or the restart of all things. This is not a time reversal; it is closer to overwriting the current “save” with a previously saved “save.”

- **Cost:** 10 points of **spirituality**.
- **Use:** A **spellcasting action**.
- **Effect:** You restart the state or what happened in a certain area, directly restarting what happened during this period and bringing the scene back to a situation you specified.
- **Targeting and range:** A certain area; you may also specify restarting only the state of one target.
- **Limits:**
  - Maximum of two encounters.
  - If you restart only one target’s state (examples given: an angel of the Error pathway or an angel of the Fool pathway), their clone and secret puppet can usually appear jointly according to your wishes.
- **Aftereffects:**
  - All recorded consumption abilities, consumed spiritual abilities, and various states in your environment are reset.
  - Exception: the spirituality consumed by Restart is not returned.

**Manifestation:**
- This ability is usually restarted together with the surrounding environment, manifested as an illusory mercury snake connected end to end.
- If you are in the form of a [[Mythical Creature Form]], the serpent transforms into you and turns to substance.

**Extra: Self-Restart (internal use)**
- In addition to being used on the entire environment, you can use Restart internally on yourself to restart your own life, allowing you to choose a couple and be born into their child.
- This washes away your current madness and corresponding negative out-of-control tendencies or states, but requires a long period of recovery as you must grow back as a baby; during this time, you must hide yourself well so you won’t be discovered.
- You cannot use this method to leap **Pathway**, because as long as you still have the [[Extraordinary characteristic of conflict]] in your body, even if you restart, **mental pollution** will always be produced and will only be eliminated for a while.
- While in the infant stage, the abilities you can use are extremely limited: almost all abilities can only be used initially, cannot achieve the desired effect, and may not even achieve half of the original effect.
- Fortunately, you can still use some [[Strong connection products]] to give the other party some [[Angel]] good luck or bad luck, and use your [[id:alias-spiritual-vision|Spiritual Vision]] to detect abnormalities.
- Your power reduction does not mean your **Lowered** (the **GM** decides how this applies).

> **GM Note:** At [[Sequence 0]], Restart is no longer limited; it includes restarting only your own state, and you can restart the entire world.
