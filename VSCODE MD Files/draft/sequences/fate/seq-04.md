# Wheel of Fortune Pathway: Sequence 4

## Misfortune Mage

The Sequence 4 Saint of the [[Wheel of Fortune Pathway]].

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Let yourself remain continuously endowed with demigod-level bad luck—far greater than your own luck ability—for a whole week, and survive.
  > **GM Note:** Marked “unofficial ceremony” in the RAW.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Luck** +3, **Inspiration** +3; choose two different skills to increase a level.

### Remove Doom

- **Cost:** 3 **spirituality points**
- **Use:** Free action; once per round
- **Effect:** Remove the effect of **doom** from a person.

### Misfortune

- **Cost:** Spellcasting action; 8 **spirituality points** and X points of **Luck** to create X points of **bad luck**
- **Targeting and range:** Designate an area; maximum range 1 kilometer
- **Effect:**
  - All assessments within the area suffer **bad luck** until the bad luck points are exhausted.
  - Within the area, all creatures (including you) share the same bad luck value.
  - Whenever anyone conducts a skill or attribute identification, the bad luck value is reduced by 4 points, and a base value penalty of 1d6 is applied.
  - When this value produces a big failure, it is bound to produce a disaster that is only for the big loser.
- **Limits:** Ends when the bad luck points are exhausted.

> **GM Note:** Unlike [[Omen of Doom]], this does not require specifying a living target. You can create an area of doom in advance as a trap, or prepare for the infliction of doom in advance, without needing to be present.

### Disaster Field

- **Cost:** 4 **spirituality points**
- **Use:** Free action; once per round
- **Targeting and range:** Select a **doom check**; a creature within your [[line of sight]]
- **Effect:** With the same amount of **bad luck** expended, you double the bad luck penalty the target suffers, changing the base numerical penalty from 1d6 to 2d6.

GM decides what qualifies as a doom check.

### Lucky Blessing

- **Cost:** Spellcasting action; 3 **spirituality points**, plus optional **Luck** to grant extra luck at a 2:1 ratio
- **Targeting and range:** Choose the lucky numbers you specify; bestow them on a target. You may designate one roll these lucky numbers apply to, treating it as a lucky roll.
- **Effect:**
  - 2 points of **Luck** spent grants the target 1 point of extra luck; 4 points of **Luck** spent grants the target 2 points of extra luck.
  - If you spend 1 point or 3 points of **Luck**, then:
    - 1 point of **Luck** cannot establish an ability, and
    - the 1 point of **Luck** overflowing from 3 points of **Luck** cannot establish an ability.
  - The target treats the added extra luck as a separate stat.
  - While the target has extra luck, it is automatically consumed on each of the target’s checks:
    - Each time the target makes a skill check, this luck automatically burns 1d3, adding to the target’s 1d20 base check.
    - On the premise of automatic burning, the target can also manually burn these lucks as a normal [[Burning Luck]] effect.
  - After 24 hours, the attached extra luck disappears.
  - A target can gain no more than half the target’s [[Spirituality]] in extra luck.

- **At Sequence 2:**
  - You can specify the strength of this luck. When you grant luck, choose a grant strength so that this luck burns 1d3, 1d6, or 2d3 at a time.
  - You can attach these lucks to an item, or even a piece of food. Anyone who holds it or eats it can get these lucks.
  - Luck attached to a single thing cannot exceed 20 points (converted by two to one; that is, 20 points of luck equals your 40 points of luck), and it can only last for 24 hours.
  - The cap that a target can gain no more than half the target’s Spirituality in extra luck remains unchanged.


### Doom Mage

- **Effect:**
  - Your doom is no longer tied to luck.
  - You gain a separate **bad luck** value for storage. Each time you [[Burning Luck]], the corresponding luck is directly converted into the same amount of stored bad luck value.
  - The maximum stored bad luck value is half of your Spirituality limit.
  - You are allowed to directly use this stored bad luck value instead of luck consumption for bad luck used in spells in the domain.
  - This kind of luck also affects yourself. As the messenger of bad luck, you will also be affected by bad luck.
  - For every certain amount of doom accumulated, the lucky problem will obviously affect your own identification until it is released.

- **Doom value effects:**

  | Doom value range | Effect |
  |---|---|
  | 0–10 points of doom | You take a final numerical penalty of 1d6 on each skill check you make. |
  | 11–20 doom points | You suffer a base score penalty of 1d3 for each skill and ability score. |
  | 21–40 doom points | You take a base numerical penalty of 1d6 on every skill and ability check you make, and a critical failure creates a disaster that affects only you. |
  | 41–60 doom points | You take a 2d6 base numerical penalty on every skill and ability check you make, and a critical failure creates two disasters that affect only you. |
  | 61–80 points of bad luck | You suffer a base numerical penalty of 3d6 for each skill and attribute check; when you fail, two disasters will only affect you. You may be very unlucky at a critical time (e.g., unable to get out of trouble due to coincidences, getting lost suddenly, or bumping into the person or thing you least want to encounter). |
  | 81 points of bad luck and above | Your bad luck effect is based on the 61–80 effect, and the special disaster will continue forever. It may take effect in each of your appraisals. A big success of burning luck can offset it once this effect, but you are likely to encounter extremely serious difficulties unless the bad luck is released. |

- **Order:** Burning Luck always happens after doom effects.

- **Temporary suppression (dispelling doom):**
  - This doom effect can be temporarily suppressed by [[dispelling doom]] once a day, lasting for one encounter, at a cost of 10 spirituality. This is an **alternative** to Remove Doom for that encounter (choose one).
  - If you still have not stored doom below 40 after the encounter is over, you suffer a geometric multiple of the backlash effect: the torrent of fate flows upstream against you, and you suffer three **doom level increases** immediately. The calamity effect takes effect, and a special calamity is generated immediately.

> **GM Note:** The RAW states the specific ability of the doom mage is not clearly shown in *Lord of Mysteries*, and that (starting at this Sequence) some extraordinary abilities for [[Destiny Pathway]] are original supplementer creations.
