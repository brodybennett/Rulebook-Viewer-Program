# Fate **Pathway**: **Sequence** 7

## The Lucky One

> **Lore:** Also known as the “lucky guy.” In daily life you might pick up money, roll dice as expected, or find that someone you like happens to like you back—but you can’t control it. This luck is passive and fluctuates.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute]] +1, [[LINK LATER: Luck | type=term | hint=attribute]] +3.
- You may replace any **skill identification** with a **Luck identification**, excluding **attribute identification**. [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=check/roll system term]]

### Luck

[[UNCLEAR: “increase X luck” and “gain X disadvantages” do not specify whether these are modifiers to a check, changes to an attribute value, extra dice, or another system-specific effect.]]

- **Use:** Passive; uncontrollable.
- **Effect:** Your luck fluctuates—sometimes very strong, sometimes ordinary—so it is difficult to fully rely on.
- **Reset:** Every 6 hours, roll 1d3 to determine your luck type for the next 6 hours:

| 1d3 | Luck type | Effect for the next 6 hours |
|---:|---|---|
| 1 | Extreme good luck | All **appraisals** increase 1d5 luck. Any appraisal intended to harm you gains 1d5 **Disadvantages**. The **GM** should guide events during this period in a direction beneficial to you as much as possible. |
| 2 | Better luck | Any **identification** increases 1d3 luck. Any identification intended to harm you gains 1d3 **Disadvantages**. The **GM** should ensure there is at least one factor beneficial to you during this period. |
| 3 | Ordinary good luck | +1 for any identification. Any identification intended to harm you gains -1 disadvantage. |

- **Special:**
  - **Disadvantage** only applies to you personally. Area attacks may harm both you and your teammates.
  - The above benefits do not affect the **sanity loss test**. [[LINK LATER: Sanity Loss Test | type=mechanic | hint=mental stability check]]

- **Special Good Luck:**
  - If you roll 1 (Extreme good luck) or 2 (Better luck), you gain **Special Good Luck** for the next 6 hours.
  - During this time, you may make a **Luck identification** with **Difficulty Value** 25 every 1d3 hours. On a success, roll 1d4 to determine what good thing you encounter:
    - If you rolled 2 (Better luck) instead of 1, the interval changes from 1d3 hours to 2d2 hours.

| 1d4 | Encountered good thing |
|---:|---|
| 1 | You pick up 1d10 money; roll 1d3 to decide whether it is a penny, a [[LINK LATER: Soli | type=term | hint=currency]], or a [[LINK LATER: Gold Pound | type=term | hint=currency (banknote)]] (banknote). |
| 2 | You meet someone or something you wanted to see; it just passes by, but you notice it. |
| 3 | You meet someone who will help you in the future, even if you don’t know the person. |
| 4 | You overhear a piece of information of value to you. |

- The **GM** may replace the 1d4 table result with other benefits they have prepared for you (without rolling).

> **GM Note:** Unlike regular skill bonuses, luck bonuses affect how a check succeeds or fails. For example, an enemy intends to hit you; their check succeeds but suffers a 1d6 penalty due to this ability. The failure of the identification should be interpreted dramatically (e.g., they step on a stone and fall, causing a hit to miss). If the enemy doesn’t know you are in the Fate Pathway, the **GM** should hide the existence of the penalty and present it as a series of coincidences.
