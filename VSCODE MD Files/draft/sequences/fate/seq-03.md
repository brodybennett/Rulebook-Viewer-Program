# Wheel of Fortune Pathway: Sequence 3

## Chaos Walker

- You are a **Sequence** 3 **Saint** of the [[LINK LATER: Wheel of Fortune Pathway | type=pathway | hint=pathway overview]].

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Disturb the torrent of fate related to yourself, make the fate orientation of this “river” no longer logical, find at least three ways of survival from this chaotic development within a day, and put them into practice at the same time.

> **GM Note:** The RAW notes this is an “unofficial ceremony,” and warns that causing chaotic fate around yourself can spill onto the city and anyone who might interact with you that day, potentially leading to sudden deaths, drawing attention from nearby forces, or being wiped out in the chaos.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Luck** +3, **Inspiration** +3, **Constitution** +1.

### Chaos Walker

- **Cost:** 5 **Spirituality Points**.
- **Use:** **Free Action**.
- **Effect:** In your environment, you reverse the course of events around you. Within a maximum of 1 kilometer of you, a **Big Success** is considered a **Big Failure**, and a **Big Failure** is considered a **Big Success**.
- **Limits:**
  - If a check has already been made and you use this ability at that time, rolls that have already been checked before that time are not affected by this ability, except for additional uses. [[UNCLEAR: “except for additional uses” does not specify what qualifies as an “additional use,” or how it changes this limitation.]]
  - Each inversion reduces your stored **Bad Luck** by 5 points or your stored **Luck** by 5 points. When only one of these values is insufficient, **Bad Luck** points will be used as **Luck** points, and **Luck** points will also be used as **Bad Luck** points.
  - When the consumption of your stored **Luck** or **Bad Luck** reaches the threshold, this ability becomes invalid. [[UNCLEAR: The “threshold” that invalidates the ability is referenced but not defined.]]
- **Duration:** Until you end it.
- **Aftereffects:** You can end the **Big Failure**/**Big Success** reversal as a **Casting Action**.

### Chaos Walker (Additional)

- **Cost:** 5 **Spirituality Points** (the same cost as Chaos Walker).
- **Use:** Once per **Round**.
- **Effect:** This can be used on a **Big Success** or a **Big Failure** of an **Appraisal** without opening it. A target’s **Big Success** is regarded as a **Big Failure**, and a target’s **Big Failure** is regarded as a **Big Success**, but it doubles the amount of **Doom** or **Luck** you have stored.
- **Limits:** If Chaos Walker is already activated, this additional ability is considered assimilated with the area ability and cannot be applied again.

### Destiny: Disturb the Torrent of Fate

- **Cost:** 10 **Spirituality Points**.
- **Use:** 1 **Spellcasting Action**; once per **Encounter**.
- **Targeting and range:** Everyone within 1 kilometer of you, excluding yourself.
- **Effect:**
  - Each affected target immediately conducts a **Luck Test**.
  - Those who pass the **Luck Appraisal** at **Difficulty Value** 20 immediately take an action; that action is directly regarded as a **Big Success**.
  - Those who fail the **Luck Appraisal** immediately suffer a calamity, and their next **Appraisal** will definitely fail.
- **Limits:** This ability cannot be reversed between **Big Failure** and **Big Success**.
