# Sequence 8: Robot

> **Lore:** Terrifying computing power and precise control greatly enhance body-related qualities, creating talent in fighting and shooting—alongside divination and anti-divination.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +2, Agility +1, **Inspiration** +2.
- You can quickly learn fighting/shooting related skills.

### Fighting/Shooting Skill Learning

- **Use:** When receiving qualifying instruction.
- **Effect:**
  1. Whenever you receive at least **2 hours** of non-repetitive and effective related courses, you can choose the Strength/Agility related skills corresponding to the course content to increase by **1 level**. To reach **Proficient**, you must complete **2 + 3 + 4** learnings in order; you cannot advance beyond **Proficient**.
  2. You can only learn once a day to digest knowledge, and you can learn quickly to master at most, and you will no longer lose your balance. GM decides the precise cap implied by “master” here.
 - **Special:** When creating a character that is not just promoted, you can use twice the Inspiration brought by the potion to add growth skills. GM decides how this applies at character creation.

### Divination

- **Cost:** Spend **3 points of Spirituality**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** **1 spell-casting action**; perform **1 Inspiration test**. [[Spell-Casting Action]] [[Inspiration Test]]
- **Effect:** You get information directly through your terrifying calculation ability and perception of the long river of fate. [[river of fate]]
- **Difficulty Value results:** [[Difficulty Value]]
  - **Difficulty Value 15:** Get a very general result; for finding objects, it will only tell you a city.
  - **Difficulty Value 20:** Get a more general result, which usually gives you a general direction.
  - **Difficulty Value 25:** Obtain a fairly accurate result; object finding will be accurate to a certain street.
  - **Difficulty Value 30:** Obtain a very accurate result; divination will reveal a specific content.
- **Identification failure:** Repeated divination will only get the same result; you need to obtain new clues to do divination again. [[Clues]]
- **Great success:** The results obtained are extremely accurate; content is specific, and time, place, and people are revealed. [[Great Success]]
- **Big failure:** According to the final value of the appraisal, you still obtain the corresponding content, but attract the attention of related beings. If the corresponding content did not involve hidden beings, instead, the directly or indirectly related Extraordinary noticed being watched. [[Big Failure]] [[Extraordinary]]
- **Aware of the gaze:** Requires a **spiritual intuition test**; the existence of targets higher than your Sequence by 1+ is detected by default regardless of the difficulty. [[Spiritual Intuition Test]]
- **Special:** Before obtaining new clues, repeated divination in the same direction will only get the same result, regardless of difficulty.

#### Other divination factors

1. Divination of things involving other people fails by default if there is no clue, and succeeds by default if there is their blood or belongings. [[divination clues]]
2. For each clue obtained, divination related events will be **+2 beneficial**, but the divination of targets higher than you by 1+ Sequence will fail by default.
3. The reason for the detection and failure of the higher level is that under special circumstances, it is possible for the lower level (character tier) to divination for the higher level.
4. Whenever you are in a deep sleep, you can conduct an Inspiration appraisal with a difficulty of **20**. If it succeeds, and something directly related to you has happened in the current period, you will see a general picture that needs to be interpreted. This is the first step of dream interpretation kind of use. [[dream interpretation]] [[deep sleep]]

### Anti-divination

- **Cost:** Spend **3 points of Spirituality**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** **1 casting action**. [[Casting Action]]
- **Effect:** Choose 1 specific mystical information related to you (e.g., you plan to attack someone next), realize anti-divination, and make an opposed check: your **Inspiration** identification against their divination check. [[Inspiration identification]]
- **Special:** The divination of the machine is directly related to the river of fate/spiritual world, so there is no need for divination media such as tarot cards. [[spiritual world]] [[divination media]]

### Calculation

- **Effect:** You have a terrifying calculation ability.
  1. **Interpretation of divination:** No action required. **Difficulty Value 20** Inspiration identification; you can directly know the meaning of the divination content.
  2. **Precision Combat:** As long as you are not in a state of madness/awe/emotion, you will continue to gain the benefits of the special action of gaining momentum and aiming. [[Madness]] [[awe]] [[emotion]] [[Gaining Momentum]] [[Aiming]]
  3. **Explain the status quo:** You will no longer fall into a semi-trance state due to extremely high Inspiration, and you can distinguish the difference between the divination picture and reality. [[semi-trance state]]
  4. **Deduce things:** **1 spell-casting action**, **Difficulty Value 20** Inspiration identification. You can make the fuzzy memory in your mind clear again through deduction; in this way, you will never forget, and you can guess the next approximate event without divination develop.
     - **Special:** For every clue, this identification is **+2 beneficial**, but if the memory content involves extraordinary factors, or when you speculate on the development of the event, you do not get all the information, you may get wrong information, and you cannot guess what you don’t know clue. [[Extraordinary Factors]]
  5. **Quick dodge:** You use deduction to retain complete physical defense against light/lightning instead of firearms, and get an extra level of dodge. [[firearms]] [[Dodge]]
  6. Use of other reasonable computing power that is permitted by the **GM**.

- **Limits:**
  - This is the benefit brought by the potion, which cannot be stolen or recorded. [[Potion]]
  - The calculation ability is often not as good as your divination ability.
  - The pure calculation ability cannot allow you to perceive the surroundings normally without identification under the premise of blindness. [[blindness]]
