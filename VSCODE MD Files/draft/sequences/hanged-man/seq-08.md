# Sequence 8: The Listener

> **Lore:** In ancient times they were called “whisperers.” They can directly hear the whispers of the corresponding hidden existence, gaining many powerful, twisted, and unique abilities. However, if they cannot be promoted, it is difficult to survive for more than five years. “Listeners” are all lunatics—even if they usually behave normally, they must be hidden lunatics.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +2; **Will** +1.
- **Skill Gain:** **Listen** +2 skill levels.  
  - Your **Listen** skill can hear the unique sounds from extraordinary creatures.
  - Your **Listen** skill is added to the rapid improvement of [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9 | type=sequence | hint=rapid improvement rules]] and can be improved at most to the master.

### Listening Perception

- **Effect:** With the extraordinary ability of listening, you will hear more sounds and get more dangers in a normal environment.
- **Trigger (extraordinary sounds):** Whenever there are sounds of extraordinary significance around you, from beings 1 higher than you or tainted beings [[LINK LATER: Tainted Being | type=condition | hint=tainted entity category]], you suffer an immediate 1/1d2 **Sanity** [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=mechanic | hint=sanity and sanity loss rules]] loss.
- **On Sanity check:** Whenever you make a **Sanity check** [[LINK LATER: Sanity Check | type=mechanic | hint=check triggered by sanity loss sources]] because of this, you immediately determine what the source of the sound is (usually only known by the type of creature, dead or alive, adult or child, and so on).
- **Spotting spirits:** You can use **Listen** instead of **Stealth** [[LINK LATER: Stealth | type=mechanic | hint=skill]] to spot spirits [[LINK LATER: Spirit | type=condition | hint=spirit entity type]].
- **Blind hearing:** While blind, you can locate others without checks.
- **If the target does not actively make a sound:** If the being 1 higher than you, or possessing pollution [[LINK LATER: Pollution | type=condition | hint=taint/pollution mechanic]], does not actively make a sound:
  - You can perform a listening detection with **Difficulty Value** [[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=mechanic | hint=check difficulty system]] 20.
  - The **Difficulty Value** is -1 for every 1 meter closer, until the default is successful; it will also cause **Sanity** loss.

[[UNCLEAR: The clause “at the time of detection of 4 …” is unclear (what “detection of 4” refers to and how it modifies the above rule).]]
- At the time of detection of 4, if the target 1 higher than you does not release pollution and mythical runes [[LINK LATER: Mythical Rune | type=mechanic | hint=mythical rune concept]], then only when the target with pollution is detected will cause **Sanity** loss.

> **GM Note:** (This is an explanation, ancillary to the ability of listening, which disappears when the latter disappears.)

### Latent Madness

> **Lore:** All “Listeners” are madmen. Even if they behave normally, they must be hidden madmen.

- **Requirement:** Can only be obtained when potion digestion reaches 10. [[LINK LATER: Potion Digestion | type=mechanic | hint=potion digestion progress/thresholds]]
- **Effect:** Your temporary madness [[LINK LATER: Temporary Madness | type=condition | hint=madness duration category]] will not affect your actions, but the madness still exists.
- **Does not include:** extraordinary madness [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Madness | type=condition | hint=madness category]], indeterminate madness [[LINK LATER: Indeterminate Madness | type=condition | hint=madness category]], and permanent madness [[LINK LATER: Permanent Madness | type=condition | hint=madness category]].
- **Special:** (This is an explanation and cannot be recorded or stolen.)

### LISTEN

- **Use:** 1 **swift action** [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]; once a round.
- **Cost:** Consumes 2 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource pool]]
- **Check:** Perform a 30-**Difficulty Value** listening appraisal.
- **Special:** When holding this extraordinary ability, your **Listen** skill will increase by another 2 levels; when this ability disappears, that increase disappears.
- **Narrative truth:** Regardless of the results of your listening, you have actually heard the words of the Creator [[LINK LATER: Creator | type=term | hint=cosmic entity]]; it is only possible to interpret the curse from them.

#### Listening appraisal success

- Roll rd8 to determine the effect. [[LINK LATER: rd8 | type=mechanic | hint=random determination roll notation]]
- Each time (regardless of outcome), take a 0/1d2 **Sanity** loss.
- For 24 hours, you can use the obtained effect as a **swift action**, but only once per round.
  - 1 ability use opportunity can be stacked.

Effects (rd8):
- ① Choose a target within your field of vision [[LINK LATER: Field of Vision | type=mechanic | hint=targeting requirement]]; they are flooded with filthy and depraved ravings, and suffer a 1d2/1d4 loss of **Sanity**.
- ② The hostile extraordinary ability that targets you once, and no more than 1 character, will fail strangely. This is a kind of substitute: your shadow helps you resist this attack, and the damage to the area ability can only be reduced by half. [[LINK LATER: Area Ability | type=mechanic | hint=area effect targeting]]
- ③ Your body suddenly squirms, and a small circle grows out of thin air, gaining 3d6 extra life (which can be replaced by a stack of flesh and blood).
- ④ Lasts for 1 hour: you lose your vitals, and you are regarded as a corrupt (flesh and blood) creature [[LINK LATER: Corrupt Creature (Flesh and Blood) | type=condition | hint=creature category]]. Regular vital strikes [[LINK LATER: Vital Strike | type=mechanic | hint=vital strike rules]] are invalid for you.
- ⑤ You can use 1 **swift action** to choose one of your own limbs to explode, causing 3d6 physical and 1d6 poison damage [[LINK LATER: Poison Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] (fighting against physical defense [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]]). On failure, the damage is halved, and you will take full damage.  
  (Blown-up limbs cannot be restored by conventional means.)
- ⑥ Select a target within the field of vision; their shadow suddenly activates and restrains them, and uses movement and attack actions to fight against their own strength attribute until they escape.  
  (Shadow rolls are made by you or the GM.)
- ⑦ Lasts 1 hour: you can use 1 round of freedom to become a shadow or escape, and lose the ability after 1 round.
- ⑧ You can shoot flesh and blood bullets at 1 or more targets, up to 3 rounds; identify the corresponding number of times. Each round, lose 1d2 HP [[LINK LATER: HP | type=mechanic | hint=hit points]]. Inspiration + shooting (against physical defense); there is no disadvantage and it is regarded as a firearm [[LINK LATER: Firearm | type=item | hint=weapon category]]. Each round causes 1d6 physical damage.
- ⑧ If you hear the ravings of other existences of the real Creator, the effect obtained will be determined by the GM, generally not including the Seven Gods. [[LINK LATER: Seven Gods | type=term | hint=setting pantheon]]

[[UNCLEAR: The success table says “rd8,” but the listed effects include two entries labeled “⑧,” implying more than eight outcomes or an alternate branch that is not clearly separated.]]

#### Listening appraisal failure

- Make an rd4 [[LINK LATER: rd4 | type=mechanic | hint=random determination roll notation]] to determine what happens if you fail your luck check. [[LINK LATER: Luck Check | type=mechanic | hint=luck test rules]]

Outcomes:
- ① You immediately suffer 2d6 curse damage [[LINK LATER: Curse Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] and suffer 1/1d2 **Sanity** loss.
- ② If you have not deciphered anything, make a **Will** test with **Difficulty Value** 15; otherwise you will lose 1/1d2 **Sanity**.
- ③ You immediately fall into a temporary madness and suffer 1/1d2 **Sanity** loss.
- ④ You immediately fall into an extraordinary madness and suffer a **Sanity** loss of 1/1d3.
- ⑤ You heard ravings from other than the real Creator, and the effect is determined by the GM, generally not including the Seven Gods.

[[UNCLEAR: The failure text specifies “rd4,” but lists five outcomes (①–⑤), and it is unclear how the “luck check” interacts with the rd4 result.]]
