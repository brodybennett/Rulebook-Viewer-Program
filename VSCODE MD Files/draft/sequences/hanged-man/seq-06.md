# Sequence 6: Bishop Rose

## Bishop Rose

> **Lore:** Mastering flesh and blood magic, Bishop Rose excels at physical healing and can become pure flesh and blood to evade detection by hiding inside other bodies—at a lethal cost to the host when it exits. It must frequently replenish flesh and blood.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +2, Strength +2, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
- **Skills:**
  - Your Biology is included in your [[Rapid Improvement Category]] (up to [[Proficient]]).
  - Occult can be promoted to [[Master]].

### Bishop Rose Traits

- You are long-term considered a **Corrupted Creature** [[Corrupted Creature]].
  - You cannot be critically hit [[Critical Hit]] by effects other than the [[Weakness Attack]] of the [[Red Priest]].
- Your physical state no longer represents your remaining health, and you can survive even if you are almost turned into a corpse.
- This is a potion effect and cannot be stolen or recorded.

### Flesh Devour

- **Cost:** No **Sanity** [[Sanity]].
- **Use:** Varies by creature size (swift / casting / full-round; see “Devouring time by size” below).
- **Targeting and range:** Touch; one helpless creature.
- **Effect:**
  - The target is brought into your flesh.
  - Creatures brought into your flesh become your **Flesh Stack** and provide **Satiety** [[Satiety]].
  - **Flesh Stack** is the value that determines how much flesh and blood you can hold; you can stack it up to 150.
  - A creature provides as many Flesh Stacks as its maximum health. Excluding [[Extraordinary]], larger creatures usually provide more Flesh Stacks.  
    [[UNCLEAR: Flesh Devour says Flesh Stacks equal a creature’s maximum health, but also provides a size-based Flesh Stack table with fixed/dice values.]]
- **Flesh Stacks by size (life limit):**
  - (If the following creatures die tragically and their limbs are mutilated, the host will judge how much flesh and blood are left.)
  1. Tiny creatures (bugs, ants): Count every 10 as 1; 1 Flesh Stack per ten.
  2. Small creatures (mouse, bird, hand, steak): 2d2 Flesh Stacks.
  3. Small and medium-sized creatures (cats, dogs): 7+1d3 Flesh Stacks; large dogs get an additional +1d3.
  4. Medium-sized creatures (humans, murlocs, young lions or tigers): 10+2d3 Flesh Stacks.
  5. Medium and large creatures (adult lions, tigers, bears, cows): 20 Flesh Stacks; meat pigs, etc. +1d5.
  6. Large creatures (giants, large creatures, Feysacs): 20+2d4 Flesh Stacks.
  7. Very large creatures (creatures comparable in size to a ship, 4-meter or 6-meter giants, creatures that can cause ship destruction): 60+10d2 Flesh Stacks, or even more.
  8. Extraordinary-related creatures: Directly calculate the upper limit of blood volume [[Blood Volume]], and restore their remaining **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]]; the spiritual recovery can exceed half of the upper limit.  
     [[UNCLEAR: The target/recipient of “restore their remaining Spirituality” and what “upper limit” refers to here is unclear.]]
  - The above random values determine individual differences.
- **Devouring time by size:**
  - Devouring ① requires only 1 swift action.
  - ②–③: 1 casting action.
  - ④–⑤: 1 full-round action.
  - ⑥: 2 full-round actions.
  - ⑦: At least 3 full-round actions (depending on the situation).
- **Special (Extraordinary-related creatures):**
  - Ensure their characteristics [[Characteristics]] have been extracted first; otherwise devouring may lead to promotion identification.
  - Because characteristics become extraordinary in the body of the [[Jumping Path]], the [[Shepherd's Grazing]] can directly solve this problem, allowing characteristics to be separated immediately.  
    [[UNCLEAR: The terms “promotion identification,” “jumping path,” and “Shepherd’s Grazing” are referenced without definitions here.]]

### Flesh Alteration

- **Effect:** You can alter your flesh; your flesh is affected by your Flesh Stack.
- This ability has two usages: passive and active.
- **Passive (subordinate to Flesh Devour):**
  - This passive part cannot be recorded. Stealing will not cause flesh and blood to disintegrate.
  - This is a permanent physical change; it does not require continued spell consumption to maintain.
  - When your Flesh Stack reaches 50:
    - Gain 3 Armor [[Armor]] and 3 Physical Damage Reduction [[Physical Damage Reduction]].
    - These do not stack with other physical benefits.
  - When your Flesh Stack reaches 120:
    - Strength +1; Constitution +1.
    - You are considered a **Big Volume Creature** [[Big Volume Creature]].
    - **Large creature benefits (while considered a Big Volume Creature):**
      - Melee against medium-sized creatures increases damage by 1d3 and attack range by 1 meter.
      - Medium-sized creatures give you +2 check.  
        [[UNCLEAR: “+2 check” vs medium-sized creatures does not specify which checks or situations it applies to.]]
  - Being bulky affects your appearance, but you can compress flesh so that the benefits of bulky creatures disappear.
    - Compressing flesh increases flesh density to avoid changes in appearance.
    - Compressing flesh does not affect the attribute bonuses gained from Flesh Stack.
  - Flesh Stack contributes to your upper limit of blood volume first, until your upper limit of blood volume reaches 80.
    - Given a Flesh Stack cap of 150, on the premise of not affecting life, the Flesh Stack you can freely use is: `150-(80-your true health)`.  
      [[UNCLEAR: “upper limit of blood volume,” “life,” and “true health” are referenced without definitions here.]]
- **Active:** You can change the appearance and form of your physical body.
  1. **Appearance adjustment:** You can change your initial charm from 1 to 6.
     - Changing 1 point takes 1 day.
     - Changing a major appearance takes 1 week.
     - Unlike [[Faceless]], this change is gradual “pinching and modeling” little by little.
  2. **Incarnation of flesh and blood:** 1 move action.
     - Change from a human form into a wriggling pool of flesh and blood.
     - You can enter places that are usually inaccessible, or enter the body of a helpless, voluntary target.
     - While inside, it is up to you to perform flesh and blood fusion; otherwise you simply stay inside.
     - Once incarnated, you have liquid qualities that allow you to seep into floors and similar spaces where struggling creatures are generally inaccessible.
  3. **Fusion of flesh and blood:** 1 spellcasting action.
     - Prerequisite: You are incarnated inside the host’s body.
     - You and the host’s flesh and blood fuse; the threads of the spirit body overlap.
     - This cannot be discovered by the [[Marionette Master]], the [[Eye of the Secret]], etc.
     - This does not include beings higher than 1 person.  
       [[UNCLEAR: The limit “does not include beings higher than 1 person” is unclear.]]
     - **Warning:** If you perform flesh and blood fusion, getting out of the body causes the death of the host; “more than 1 digit” causes combat damage.  
       [[UNCLEAR: “More than 1 digit will cause combat damage” is unclear.]]
  4. **Flesh shaping:** 1 casting action.
     - Change your body into various shapes and perform corresponding functions (e.g., turn your upper body into a vortex to draw the gas in the area onto you alone; block in front of others to resist damage).
     - You can turn body parts into tools like blades; the effect corresponds to the usual version, excluding precision firearms.
  5. **Flesh Wrap:** 1 attack/move action.
     - Prerequisite: Flesh shaping.
     - Wrap objects that have not been transformed into flesh piles inside your body to store or transport them to a safe location for further processing.
     - Wrapped objects cannot be compressed; wrapping objects taller than you can leave them exposed.
     - You can digest wrapped objects at any time.
     - As long as the contaminated object is not digested and spit out in time afterward, it will not cause too much damage.  
       [[UNCLEAR: Timing and consequences for “not digested and spit out in time” are not specified.]]

### Cellular Proliferation

- **Effect:** Your cells grow faster than normal living organisms.
- **Passive (Flesh Stack regeneration):**
  1. Based on your Flesh Stack, every 12 hours, even if you don’t devour any flesh and blood, your Flesh Stack value can also be +10.
  2. This auto-recovering Flesh Stack ends when your upper limit of life reaches 80 [[Life Cap]], because the upper limit of life brought by Flesh Stack increases with Sequence; at higher Sequence this becomes the corresponding higher upper limit of life.

**Flesh Magic:** You gain the following flesh magic; every “Rose Bishop” is an expert in flesh magic. The following flesh and blood magic are all separate abilities, and only one benefit can be selected when creating [[Extraordinary Items]].

### Flesh Cloak

- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality**; 20 Flesh Stacks once a round.
- **Use:** 1 swift action.
- **Effect:** Weave scarlet flesh and fallen blood into a strange, viscous red cloak that wraps your body and grants:
  1. Gain 5 points of external damage reduction [[External Damage Reduction]]; this can be superimposed with the reduction from Flesh Stack.
  2. The cloak can withstand a limited number of damages equal to the value of Flesh Stack consumed.
     - Each time it suffers non-physical damage, deduct 1 time.
     - If it suffers from divine power [[Divine Power]], deduct 5 times each time.
     - It can be repaired by repeated casting.
  3. Making the Flesh Cloak consumes up to 40 Flesh Stacks; consuming more than 40 does not grant additional benefits.
  4. The Flesh Stacks of the Flesh Cloak can be recovered by devouring flesh and blood, which consumes 1 full-round action.
- **Special:**
  - Damage higher than 1 character of yours consumes 3 more resist times; holy damage [[Holy Damage]] consumes 5 more times.
  - If it is 2 characters higher than you, regardless of damage type, the cloak is annihilated after resisting 1 effect; holy causes the cloak to not even take effect.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “Character higher” (difference thresholds and what counts as “holy” vs “divine power”) is undefined here, and the relationship between “20 Flesh Stacks once a round” and “consumes up to 40 Flesh Stacks” is ambiguous.]]

### Flesh Bomb

- This ability has two uses.

1. **Thrown flesh bomb**
   - **Cost:** Consumes 5 points of blood and flesh stack.  
     [[UNCLEAR: This cost does not clearly state whether it consumes blood, Flesh Stack, or both.]]
   - **Use:** 1 spellcasting action.
   - **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target; “throw” against physical defense [[Physical Defense]].
   - **Effect:**
     - Deal 3d6 physical damage and 1d6 poison damage [[Poison Damage]].
     - On failure, damage is halved (rounded up).
     - Two creatures standing next to each other count as the same target.
   - **Special:**
     - It can only consume blood or serve as a pile of flesh and blood as the upper limit of blood.  
       [[UNCLEAR: The meaning of “only consume blood or serve as a pile…as the upper limit of blood” is unclear.]]
     - You may tear off one of your limbs and throw it:
       - The bomb’s damage is doubled.
       - This usage can affect all creatures within a 10-meter area.
       - You take a -4 penalty each time you fight or roll; movement is halved, until you use [[Flesh Mending]].  
         [[UNCLEAR: “Flesh Mending” is referenced but not defined in this section.]]
2. **Planted flesh bomb**
   - **Cost:** Consumes 5 Flesh Stacks.
   - **Use:** 1 spellcasting action; requires physical contact.
   - **Targets:** An ordinary person who is helpless, voluntary, or a target who is 1 lower than you.
   - **Effect:** After casting, the target is regarded as being planted by you as a flesh bomb (status).
     - **Planting a flesh bomb status:** There is a flesh bomb in the body.
       - Creatures that are less than large in size are only allowed to stack 5 points of flesh.
       - The owner of the flesh bomb can detonate them at any time within a range of 100 meters.
       - Damage caused by the bomb in the body is doubled.
     - **Detonate:** Detonating a bomb is a casting action; costs 3 points of Spirituality; you can detonate at most equal to the number of Inspirations.  
       [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether the detonation limit “equal to the number of Inspirations” is per action, per round, or per other interval.]]
     - Ordinary people who are detonated die on the spot by default and become a blood storm.
       - The corpse causes another 1 time of damage to creatures around 5 meters away from the conventional blood bomb; it is no longer an explosion, but depends on the harmful substances of the blood storm and the human body.
   - (Generally speaking, this use can’t work on yourself, because the bomb will also hurt you, and the damage caused is not worth the loss.)

### Flesh Manipulation

- **Use:** 1 swift action; once per round.
- **Effect:** Animate the flesh and blood of a lifeless host to perform 1 action.
  - Example: You can use your Flesh Cloak or [[Flesh Blanket]] to grapple [[Grapple]] the enemy.
    - The bonus of flesh is its Flesh Stack/2.
    - The Flesh Stack also represents its HP.
    - For the rest, refer to Flesh Blanket.
- **Additional uses (each consumes a free action controlled by flesh and blood):**
  1. Precisely manipulate the shape of flesh and blood; make it melt and become fluid; draw words and portraits yourself.
  2. Based on ①, stop all reactions of the flesh and blood and even make the blood solid without polluting the surroundings.
  3. Think of it as a kind of “clone” of you: let it enter a specific area instead of you.
     - It cannot exceed 100 meters from you.
     - You do not share your senses with it; it can at most work within your sight.
  4. Based on ③, because it has no intelligence and you are manually manipulating it, you cannot “create” flesh and blood creatures to become servants.
     - Manipulation precision is not enough; you can only use abstract forms such as cloaks and giant carpets.
  5. Leave a simple spiritual imprint in flesh and blood (e.g., a sentence as a message).
     - Other Rose Bishops can perceive the content of the spiritual imprint.
     - Other Rose Bishops can also obtain the information you left by divination on the flesh and blood.
- **Passive:** When you have this ability, you can directly use external flesh and blood with no living owner as the material for your flesh magic (e.g., immediately suppress the life of a bomb-dead host into a cape).

### Flesh Healing

- **Cost:** 3 points of Spirituality; up to 20 Flesh Stacks per use.
- **Use:** 1 swift action; 1 time per round.
- **Effect:** You use your accumulated flesh and blood to heal damage.
  - If you have lost the upper limit of your flesh and blood piles, or they are all destroyed and your body’s health is lost, the Flesh Stacks you consume can be refilled into your health—restoring health or increasing your life cap again.
- **Special:** If you were mutilated when you cast Flesh Bomb, Flesh Healing consumes the same amount of Flesh Stack you lost when you cast Flesh Bomb to restore your body.

### Blanket of Flesh

- **Cost:** 3 points of Spirituality; at least 10 and at most 40 Flesh Stacks.
- **Use:** 1 swift action; once per round.
- **Effect:** Create a giant blanket of fur that you can manipulate with flesh to perform 1 action each round.
  1. Its actions are limited; unless you have more ideas, it can only perform grappling special actions.
  2. For every 10 Flesh Stacks consumed, the blanket can grab 1 person; consuming 40 Flesh Stacks allows it to grab 3 people at the same time.
  3. Determine its action bonus, mobility, and physical defense using its current Flesh Stack/2.
     - Agility and dodge are half of those values (rounded down).
     - Roll: rd20 + action bonus against the target’s physical defenses; on success, grapple it.
  4. Grappled people must stand together; the distance between them cannot exceed Flesh Stack/2.
  5. The blanket’s Flesh Stack value is its health value; if its health value is lower than 10, it cannot continue the grapple action.

### Flesh Bullet

- **Cost:** 2 Flesh Stacks per bullet.
- **Use:** 1 attack action; up to 6 consecutive shots.
- **Targeting and range:** One or more targets.
- **Effect:**
  - Meat sticks protrude from your body and shoot at targets.
  - Make an attack of Inspiration + shooting against physical defense, ignoring agility and evasion in physical defense.
  - Each meat stick deals 1d6 physical damage.
- **Aftereffects:** Gain a -2 penalty for each burst, starting with the second shot.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “Burst” penalty timing (per shot vs per volley) is not fully specified.]]
