# Hanged Man Pathway: Sequence 3

## Trinity Templar

- You can **separate your body** and **drive** three [[Soul]]s at the same time.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Divide your consciousness or [[Spirit Body]] into three independent existences representing your young self, present self, and old self; reconcile with yourself; then return to integrity under a common belief or will.
  > **GM Note:** The source labels this as an “unofficial ceremony.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Willpower (WIL) +2.

### Three Songs

- **Effect:**
  - You can drive three [[Soul]]s at the same time.
  - In one Round, you can use the skills of three different souls.
  - You gain 3 additional Casting Actions; these casting actions can only activate active abilities of [[Spirit]]s you control.
  - As a Free Action, two additional heads grow on your shoulders—one young and one old—both part of your appearance.
- **Aftereffects / Special:**
  - When you enter [[Madness]], one of your heads enters madness for you. During the madness time limit, the number of souls you can drive at the same time is reduced by -1, up to two times. Your [[Grazing Cap]] is reduced by 1.  
    This penalty can stack up to **-2** while the madness lasts.

### Body Separation

- **Trigger:** When your [[Blood Bar]] is empty.
- **Effect (choose one):**
  - **Option A (survive fatal injury):** Permanently reduce the number of souls you can drive at the same time by -1; you are immune to this [[Fatal Injury]].
  - **Option B (split into three bodies):**
    - Have your other two heads take away one-third of your body.
    - This consumes a whole round of actions.
    - Then, through the principle of [[Flesh and Blood Magic]], each of you turns back into a complete single body.
    - From now on, you can control three different “you” at the same time.
- **Limits / Restrictions (Option B):**
  - You cannot share all [[Grazing Methods]].
  - You must allocate the corresponding grazing souls for the two clones to use independently.
  - When splitting, you suffer 1d3 [[Sanity / Rationality Check]]s for minor splits, or 1d6 for major splits.
- **Clones (Option B):**
  - The two separated bodies are not regarded as [[Beyonder]]s of the same Hanged Man Pathway as you.
  - You can give them two different grazing souls; in doing so, you lose the operation rights of those two grazing souls, and the two clones can use the complete corresponding soul abilities and can open [[Mythical Creature Form]].
  - Their stats are treated as your stats without strengthening from extraordinary abilities.
    - Example: for the transformation ability of the [[id:alias-black-knight|Black Knight]], they do not gain the Black Knight’s data enhancement, but they do use your existing attribute data and sanity data.
- **Loss / Regeneration (Option B):**
  - If a clone is eliminated during this process, you are considered to have lost it almost permanently; you need at least 10 years to regenerate it.
  - Therefore, unless you have been promoted to Sequence 1, you should cherish them. Sequence 1 of the same Pathway can regenerate them after a day.
