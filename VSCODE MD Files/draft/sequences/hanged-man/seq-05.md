# Sequence 5: Shepherd

## Shepherd

- You can **Graze** other people’s souls (including resentful souls and evil spirits) into your body.
- You can then **Drive** a grazed soul in a unique way (like shepherding lambs for the gods), selectively using three abilities from that soul.
- You can graze up to 7 souls.
- You can drive only 1 soul at a time, but you can change the driven soul instantly.
- If the herding target is demigod-level, it can be released directly because of its strong spirit body, but only 1 at a time. [[UNCLEAR: “Released directly” here overlaps with later “Release the soul” rules, but appears to describe a different effect (released yet still controlled).]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Increase the fit between your soul and body, and either:
  - be completely regarded as the same kind by the fallen power, or
  - isolate the influence of the fallen field.
- (This is described as an “unofficial ceremony”.)

> **GM Note:** “Those who want to graze lambs will be grazed themselves.” At the moment of promotion, Beyonders show signs of being “grazed”: their souls and [[Extraordinary characteristics]] are gradually withdrawn, becoming lambs (burnt offerings) herded by the gods. The ritual is described as necessary to (a) increase compatibility between soul and integrated Extraordinary characteristics in mystical and physical senses, and (b) be treated as an “angel” rather than a “lamb” by the herding power, or to block that influence so grazing cannot occur.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
- Biology can be quickly upgraded to Erudition. [[UNCLEAR: “Biology” and “Erudition” are not defined here; unclear what “quickly upgraded” mechanically entails.]]

### Herding

- **Effect:** You devour other people’s souls into your body and drive them like lambs for the gods.

- **Graze ([[full-round action]]):**
  - As a full-round action, choose a dead target and graze it.
  - The target must be within 5 minutes of death (its [[spirit body]] has not dissipated, and its Extraordinary characteristics have not yet been released).

- **Process of Grazing Souls:**
  1. After you use Graze, the soul and Extraordinary characteristics in the target’s body merge into your body like a ray of light. The body becomes an empty shell; psychics cannot find the soul, and devouring the flesh and blood does not consume the Extraordinary characteristics.
  2. Choose any three abilities the target had to obtain (including passive abilities), excluding:
     - improvements brought by potions, and
     - subdivided skills (e.g., all categories in Sun spells): you may choose only one subdivided skill to obtain. [[Sun spells]]
  3. You may use the soul’s abilities immediately, but you can drive at most 1 soul at the same time. If you have two souls (e.g., Abyss and Witch), when you switch from Abyss to Witch, Abyss abilities disappear immediately.
     - This includes demonization, unless it is an ability like Divine Oath, which does not need to be a persistent effect that lasts forever. [[UNCLEAR: The exception clause is unclear about which abilities persist without remaining driven, and how “persistent” is determined.]]
  4. You can graze up to 7 souls, and support 1 Sequence 4 soul.
     - Sequence 4 and above souls can be released because of their strong spirit body, and can still be manipulated by you; this can bring you independent spellcasting/attack/movement/number of free actions. [[UNCLEAR: “Released” here appears to mean a controlled, manifested soul with independent actions; its interaction with the separate “Release the soul” action is unclear.]]
  5. Grazed souls continue to be tortured, in excruciating pain, and are forced to be your lambs.
  6. You cannot graze spirit bodies and characteristics with [[spiritual pollution]], which may cause you to suffer corresponding pollution.

- **Drive a Soul (no action):**
  - No action is required: choose 1 grazed soul to drive.
  - While driving it, you can use the 3 extraordinary abilities you selected from that soul; you do not need to switch between those three abilities.
  - However, switching related to grazed extraordinary items usually requires 1 [[Free Action]]; up to 6 times in 1 round. [[UNCLEAR: “Grazed extraordinary items” are not defined here; unclear what specifically is being switched.]]

- **Benefits While Using a Driven Soul’s Abilities:**
  1. When you switch to the soul of the corresponding Pathway, you immediately show the corresponding characteristics. For example:
     - [[Black Emperor Pathway]] makes you majestic immediately.
     - [[Witch Pathway]] makes you beautiful immediately; if you are male, you become neutral.
  2. When casting a corresponding ability, use the grazed soul’s skill and attribute identifiers for the skill and attribute identification. When grazing, fill in the corresponding attributes and abilities on your character card.
     - If there is no such data, treat your Inspiration + [[Mysticism]] as the corresponding attributes and skills of the soul.
     - This requires your GM’s consent; otherwise, you still need to write the data corresponding to the soul with your GM.

- **Release the Soul ([[full-round action]]):**
  - As a full-round action, you **Release** one of the spirits you graze, freeing it from suffering.
  - The freed soul remembers its experience during the herding, can be channeled, and dissipates after 3d2 questions. [[channeling a soul]]
  - Dream divination for forced psychic psychics results in a loss of 3 problem opportunities, and the soul is insufficient to maintain itself and quickly dissipates. [[UNCLEAR: “forced psychic psychics” and “problem opportunities” are unclear; trigger and exact meaning are not defined here.]]
  - The Extraordinary characteristics are discharged from your body at the moment the soul is released, and do not affect you.
  - If you die, all souls are released immediately, faster than the time for Extraordinary characteristics to be released.
