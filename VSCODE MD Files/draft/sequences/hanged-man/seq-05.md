# Hanged Man Pathway: Sequence 5

## Shepherd

- You can **Graze** other people’s souls (including resentful souls and evil spirits) into your body.
- You can then **Drive** a grazed soul in a unique way (like shepherding lambs for the gods), selectively using three abilities from that soul.
- You can graze up to 7 souls.
- You can drive only 1 soul at a time, but you can change the driven soul instantly.
- If the herding target is demigod-level, it can be released directly because of its strong spirit body, but only 1 at a time; the soul manifests but remains under your control.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Increase the fit between your soul and body, and either:
  - be completely regarded as the same kind by the fallen power, or
  - isolate the influence of the fallen field.
- (This is described as an “unofficial ceremony”.)

> **GM Note:** “Those who want to graze lambs will be grazed themselves.” At the moment of promotion, Beyonders show signs of being “grazed”: their souls and [[Extraordinary characteristics]] are gradually withdrawn, becoming lambs (burnt offerings) herded by the gods. The ritual is described as necessary to (a) increase compatibility between soul and integrated Extraordinary characteristics in mystical and physical senses, and (b) be treated as an “angel” rather than a “lamb” by the herding power, or to block that influence so grazing cannot occur.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility (DEX) +1, Intuition (INT) +1.
- Biology can be rapidly trained up to Erudition (reduced training counts).

- **Effect:** You devour other people’s souls into your body and drive them like lambs for the gods.

- **Graze ([[Full-Round Action]]):**
  - As a Full-Round Action, choose a dead target and graze it.
  - The target must be within 5 minutes of death (its [[spirit body]] has not dissipated, and its Extraordinary characteristics have not yet been released).

- **Process of Grazing Souls:**
  1. After you use Graze, the soul and Extraordinary characteristics in the target’s body merge into your body like a ray of light. The body becomes an empty shell; psychics cannot find the soul, and devouring the flesh and blood does not consume the Extraordinary characteristics.
  2. Choose any three abilities the target had to obtain (including passive abilities), excluding:
     - improvements brought by potions, and
     - subdivided skills (e.g., all categories in Sun spells): you may choose only one subdivided skill to obtain. [[Sun spells]]
  3. You may use the soul’s abilities immediately, but you can drive at most 1 soul at the same time. If you have two souls (e.g., Abyss and Witch), when you switch from Abyss to Witch, Abyss abilities disappear immediately.
     - This includes demonization; abilities like Divine Oath do not require persistence to remain.
  4. You can graze up to 7 souls, and support 1 Sequence 4 soul.
     - Sequence 4 and above souls can be released because of their strong spirit body, and can still be manipulated by you; the released soul acts with its own action economy while under your control.
  5. Grazed souls continue to be tortured, in excruciating pain, and are forced to be your lambs.
  6. You cannot graze spirit bodies and characteristics with [[spiritual pollution]], which may cause you to suffer corresponding pollution.

- **Drive a Soul (no action):**
  - No action is required: choose 1 grazed soul to drive.
  - While driving it, you can use the 3 extraordinary abilities you selected from that soul; you do not need to switch between those three abilities.
- However, switching which grazed extraordinary item is active usually requires 1 Free Action; up to 6 times in 1 round.

- **Benefits While Using a Driven Soul’s Abilities:**
  1. When you switch to the soul of the corresponding Pathway, you immediately show the corresponding characteristics. For example:
     - [[Black Emperor]] makes you majestic immediately.
     - [[Demoness]] makes you beautiful immediately; if you are male, you become neutral.
  2. When casting a corresponding ability, use the grazed soul’s skill and attribute identifiers for the skill and attribute identification. When grazing, fill in the corresponding attributes and abilities on your character card.
     - If there is no such data, treat your Intuition (INT) + [[Mysticism]] as the corresponding attributes and skills of the soul.
     - This requires your GM’s consent; otherwise, you still need to write the data corresponding to the soul with your GM.

- **Release the Soul ([[Full-Round Action]]):**
  - As a Full-Round Action, you **Release** one of the spirits you graze, freeing it from suffering.
  - The freed soul remembers its experience during the herding, can be channeled, and dissipates after 3d2 questions. [[channeling a soul]]
- Dream divination for forced psychic psychics results in a 3-point penalty, and the soul is insufficient to maintain itself and quickly dissipates.
  - The Extraordinary characteristics are discharged from your body at the moment the soul is released, and do not affect you.
  - If you die, all souls are released immediately, faster than the time for Extraordinary characteristics to be released.

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
