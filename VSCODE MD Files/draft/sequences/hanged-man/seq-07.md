# Sequence 7: Shadow Ascetic

> **Lore:** Can hide in the shadows and wield shadow powers.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** constitution +2, agility +1, strength +1, inspiration +1.
- Your **mysticism** [[Mysticism]] can be quickly upgraded to **erudition** [[Erudition]].
- **Stealth** [[Stealth]] is added to your rapid improvement category [[Rapid Improvement Category]] and can be improved to **proficiency** at most [[Proficiency]].

### Darkvision

- **Effect:** You can see normally even in environments without any light.

### Shadow Lurking

- **Cost:** 2 points of **spirituality** [[Spirituality]].
- **Use:** 1 **movement action** [[Movement Action]] to enter **shadow state** [[Shadow State]].
- **Effect:** Your body suddenly disintegrates like a body of water, merges into the shadow, and enters **shadow state**:
  - ① You become a movable shadow; agility +3, affecting **physical defense** [[Physical Defense]] and mobility.
  - ② Gain **high-speed dodge** [[High-Speed Dodge]], keep complete **physical defense** against guns instead of light and lightning, and gain an extra level of **dodge** [[Dodge]] when facing attacks that are slower than guns; but in **shadow state**, you cannot perform actions other than using shadow abilities [[Shadow Abilities]].
  - ③ Even in an environment without other shadows, you can move freely as an independent shadow; but if you hide in a dark area or in an existing shadow, you will be considered **invisible** [[Invisible]], and exposure will result in detection and tracking.
  - ② In this state, you can pass through places that cannot be entered under normal circumstances, but you can still be hit by abilities.
  - ③ Exiting the **shadow state** is also a **movement action**, and the form of expression is to "grow" out of the shadow.
- **Special:** [[Master Puppet]], [[Eye of Mystery]], and [[id:alias-spirit-vision|Spirit Vision]] of the [[Path of Fate]] can directly discover you.

[[UNCLEAR: Shadow Lurking lists effects with duplicated item numbering (②/③ repeated), making the intended grouping and ordering of sub-effects uncertain.]]

### Shadow Package

- **Use:** 1 **attack action** [[Attack Action]] or **move action** [[Move Action]].
- **Cost:** No **spirituality** expended.
- **Limits:**
  - This is a special action, not an extraordinary ability.
  - This special action can only be used in **shadow state**.
- **Effect:**
  - Every time you take an **attack action** or **move action**, you can choose a target to let the **shadow state** "extend" from the ground.
  - Because you can't cover multiple targets at once, you need to decide the order of the targets.
  - Fight against its **physical defenses**, and success will put it into a **grapple state** [[Grapple State]].
- **Manifestation:** You jump onto the first target and wrap it around, then let the shadow quickly extend to the next target.

### Shadow Hide

- **Cost:** 2 **sanity points** [[Sanity Points]] per use.
- **Use:** 1 **swift action** [[Swift Action]].
- **Effect:** You cause your entire appearance to be covered in shadow.
  - ① Others cannot see your shadow-covered face, and can only distinguish the shape and general type of your clothing, but cannot distinguish the color or further characteristics.
  - ② You are regarded as a dark shadow, but unlike hiding in the shadow, you have an entity and can perform all normal activities.
  - ③ As long as you deliberately hide yourself, then in dark environments and other shadows, your stealth test +4 is beneficial.
- **Special:** [[Master Puppet]], [[Eye of Mystery]], and [[Vision of Destiny]] can directly see your true face.

### Shadow Manipulation

- **Cost:** 2 points of **spirituality**.
- **Use:** 1 **casting action** [[Casting Action]].
- **Targeting and range:**
  - Select up to 3 targets within the **field of vision** [[Field of Vision]].
  - You shape the existing shadows to a certain extent, and the range of influence is as high as 1 kilometer.
- **Resolution:** **mysticism** counters **physical defense**.
- **Effect:**
  - The shadows beyond the range of vision cannot be used accurately, and can only allow other **Beyonders** [[Beyonder]] to detect abnormalities with **spiritual intuition** [[Spiritual Intuition]].
  - This ability can't really shape the shadows into specific shapes; it can only turn them into an amorphous "fluid" to attack.
  - The damage depends on the concentration of the surrounding shadows or darkness:
    - ① Areas with shadows caused by occlusion in daylight: 1d6 **curse damage** [[Curse Damage]].
    - ② Areas with shadows caused by occlusion at dusk: 2d6 **curse damage**.
    - ③ Areas without high-intensity light in the dark night: 3d6 **curse damage**; high-intensity light is regarded as dusk.
    - ④ Others: A room with sufficient light is regarded as dusk, and a room without light is regarded as night, regardless of the actual time.
- **Special:** In places continuously illuminated by **divine power** [[Divine Power Illumination]], as long as the corresponding power continues to exist, the intensity of the shadow will drop by 1 level, and the day level will disappear directly, causing you to be unable to use the ability.
