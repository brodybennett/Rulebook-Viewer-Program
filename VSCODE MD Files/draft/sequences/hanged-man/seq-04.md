    - When you use the blade of flesh and blood to attack creatures whose Sanity has not reached the maximum, your hit rate +10. [[Hit Rate]]

### Spreading Flesh

- **Cost:** 2 spirituality points.
- **Use:** Spell-casting action.
- **Requirements:** **Flesh Stack** 120+ (RAW: “stack of flesh and blood”). [[Flesh Stack]]
- **Effect:**
  - Your whole body turns into a thin blanket of blood and flesh that spreads rapidly, covering every corner of the room.
  - In this state, you turn into pure flesh and blood and cover the entire room with your body; you become the walls of the entire room, and the walls are full of flesh and blood.
  - Exiting this state requires a free action to coalesce into shape.
- **Limits while active:**
  - You can only use [[Flesh Magic]] for [[Flesh Healing]]. (RAW: “excluding the passive immortal flesh.”)
  - You can still manipulate flesh creatures, or put a demigod soul outside to fight, but you can’t do more things.
  - Flesh Magic such as [[Flesh Bomb]] cannot be used.
- **Battlefield effects:**
  - The room covered by you isolates sound from inside and outside.
  - The room cannot be entered or exited by physical means.
  - Anyone else who tries to enter without your consent must kill you first.
- **Additional requirement:** This can usually only be used to cover a room to divide the battlefield. If you want to cover a lobby, your Flesh Stack must be 170+.

### Separation of Fallen Thoughts

- **Cost:** 6 spirituality points.
- **Use:** Casting action.
- **Targeting:** Designate a mad creature. [[Mad Creature]]
- **Effect:**
  - The designated creature falls into **true half-madness** [[Half-Madness]].
  - A shadow copy of this creature appears immediately.
  - Before the original owner completely kills the copy, the original owner’s madness symptoms remain permanently.
    - Generally, it can act normally, but it will be difficult to control emotions when speaking.
    - Occasionally, the madness will aggravate, but basically it will not affect actions.
    - The original owner gains the advantages and disadvantages brought by the madness. [[Madness]]
- **Copy details:**
  - The duplicate body has complete supernatural powers.
  - It shares the remaining Sanity equally with the original.
  - The Sanity upper limit and Will Defense of both parties are halved. [[Sanity Upper Limit]] [[Will Defense]]
  - It will not inherit the state of madness.
  - It is a [[Shadow Creature]] and has strong malice towards the original owner.
  - It will not possess any [[Supernatural Item]] or [[Secret Puppet]].
  - Its appearance is a dark humanoid shadow (if the original owner is human).
- **Negotiation:** You can persuade this creature to help you through negotiation. Since killing the original owner can replace it, and it is malicious to the original owner, most clones will agree to help you.
- **When the clone is killed:**
  - This essentially tears apart a person’s astral body. [[Astral Body]]
  - When the clone is killed, any split Sanity returns with the torn astral body.
- **Additional effects on the original owner:**
  - The original owner who lost half of their soul gains the easy-to-craze effect of the Spectator Pathway in a state of incomplete soul. [[Easy-to-Craze]] [[Spectator Pathway]] [[Incomplete Soul]]
  - If the original owner is replenished by an Audience demigod through a virtual personality, then even though they are still half insane, their soul can be temporarily complete. [[Audience Demigod]] [[Virtual Personality]]
    - The halving of the Sanity upper limit and the upper limit of Will Defense remains unchanged.
    - It is easy to remove the effect of madness, and the original owner no longer gains the advantages and disadvantages of half-madness.
    - The virtual personality can be used as a substitute for mental blows. [[Mental Blow]]
  - Even if the original owner is illuminated by light, there will be no shadow.

#### Special Use: Extracting a Foreign Consciousness

If you have a consciousness that does not belong to you in your mind (for example, an Audience virtual personality has invaded your mind), you can forcibly pull out this virtual personality using Separation of Fallen Thoughts.

> **Lore:** You turn your hand black and reach into your brain to grab your “island of consciousness,” smash it on the ground, and turn it into a pool of shadows. The shadows show an outline set by the owner (basically only distinguishing men and women).

- **Timing:** After it is separated, it takes two rounds to become independent.
- **Control window:** It remains under the control of its original owner for two rounds.
- **If not resolved in time:** The original owner suffers the normal detached and corrupted mind effects. [[Detached and Corrupted Mind]]
- **If this avatar was already insane before being separated:** Separation and degeneration can make it betray immediately (without waiting).
  - Usually, there must be a demigod with the same Spectator Pathway to attack it with Sanity. Your own Sanity attack can basically only be fought with yourself, and even if there is a Spectator Pathway demigod, this virtual personality can resist.
- **Restrictions:**
  - It is extremely difficult to use your own power to make it fall into madness in advance.
  - After pulling it out, because it has already begun to fall into the state of [[Separated and Corrupted Thoughts]], you cannot let it fall into the state of [[Separated and Fallen Thoughts]] again; even if you can, it only affects replicas.
  - The Sanity blow that is replenished after the withdrawal is meaningless.
