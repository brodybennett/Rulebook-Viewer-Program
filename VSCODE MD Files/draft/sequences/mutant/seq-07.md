# Sequence 7: Werewolves

## Werewolves

> **Lore:** Werewolves possess strong self-recovery, terrifying strength, agility, and speed. Their claws and teeth rival extraordinary weapons of the same Sequence, can cut through steel, and are inherently poisonous. They also know dark spells that can control targets soaked in werewolf poison and transform them into short-lived, subordinate werewolf-like monsters.

- **Curse:** Killing and bloodlust at the full moon.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Strength** +1, **Physique** +1, **Agility** +1.
- Your **Mysticism** has joined the rapid growth category of **Sequence** 9, and can be improved to proficiency at most.

### Transform Werewolf

- **Use:** **Swift Action**; perform an SC (1/1d4).
- **Effect:** You immediately transform into a werewolf.
- **Duration:** About 8 hours.
- **While transformed:**
  - **Strength** +2, **Constitution** +2, **Dexterity** +3.
  - You gain: [[LINK LATER: Pursuit | type=mechanic | hint=ability gained in werewolf form; rules not included in RAW]], **Blade Swipe**, **Fast Healing**, **Fast Dodge**, **Werewolf Transformation**, **Spiritual Curse**, **Night Vision**, and other abilities.
  - You are considered a creature of darkness and dislike sunlight, though sunlight has no actual effect on you.

### Blade Swipe

- **Effect:** Your claws are as reflective as metal, with black nails as long as daggers.
- **Damage:** 1d6 curse + 1d6 poison + Strength damage dice (physical). [[UNCLEAR: “the physical of 1d6 curse + 1d6 poison + strength damage dice” is ambiguous about damage structure; preserved as-written in a clarified layout.]]
- **Limits:** This damage cannot be superimposed with other weapons at the same time.
- **Notes:**
  1. The front paws of the wolf are still five fingers; **Blade Swipe** does not require the palm to become wolf-shaped. It can only work on the nails, making them grow like daggers.
  2. Your claws ignore armors whose hardness is equal to steel or less than steel. This includes all kinds of skin armors.
     - This does **not** include armors made of supernatural power (such as [[LINK LATER: Dawn | type=item | hint=example of supernatural armor]]), armors enchanted with supernatural power, or armor brought by dragon scales.
     - This does not ignore [[LINK LATER: Damage Reduction | type=mechanic | hint=DR rule]], it only allows you to break through the corresponding defense.
     - At the same time, your teeth can get this benefit too.

### Werewolf Transformation

- **Cost:** Consumes 2 points of [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource pool used for spellcasting]].
- **Use:** **Spell-Casting Action**.
- **Test:** [[LINK LATER: Inspiration Test | type=mechanic | hint=test type]] against the [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]].
- **Targeting and conditions:**
  - Choose a target you have dealt poison damage to with **Blade Swipe**, and the poison has been soaked into the target for five minutes.
  - Poison damage is ignored if it is fully negated by [[LINK LATER: Poison Resistance | type=mechanic | hint=negates poison damage]].
- **Effect:** After the **Spell-Casting Action**, the target is transformed into your follower and is regarded as a werewolf-like creature.
- **Limits and guidance:**
  1. The target cannot die, but can fall into a helpless state. This ability is generally used for ordinary people or existences weaker than you.
  2. If the target’s Sequence level is higher than yours, it usually requires the target to be in a helpless state to do so.
  3. Werewolf transformation has no effect on targets one higher than you, and provokes [[LINK LATER: Sanity Rolls | type=mechanic | hint=sanity check procedure]] for [[LINK LATER: Mythic Creatures | type=term | hint=creature category]].
- **Werewolf-like creatures:**
  - Usually become indifferent and fearless of death.
  - Unable to disobey the master’s order, no matter how unreasonable the order is.
  - Appearance still belongs to human beings.
  - A werewolf-like creature can take SC (1/1d3) as a **Swift Action** to become [[LINK LATER: Half-Lycanthropy | type=condition | hint=partial werewolf state]].
    - The creature grows thick hair like a werewolf, gains **Strength** +2 and **Dexterity** +2, and has 1d6 **Fast Healing**.
  - Without further benefit, this werewolf-like creature can only live for 24 hours, whether transformed or not.
- **Purging the poison:**
  - The poison from **Blade Swipe** can be purged; initially requiring only a 10 [[LINK LATER: Medicine Check | type=mechanic | hint=skill check]] as a **Casting Action**.
  - **Difficulty Value** +5 every minute.
  - Any extraordinary ability related to healing can also gain this effect, without the need for a medical check.
  > **GM Note:** The setting’s education level is not widespread enough; if this person is not an intellectual, they may not even have the consciousness to attempt this.

### Fast Healing

- **Use:** Passive.
- **Effect:** Once per round, you recover 1d6 hit points.
- **Notes:**
  1. When you have this ability, you will not be in a near-death state due to reasons other than insufficient health, excluding blows from more than 1 character. [[UNCLEAR: “excluding blows from more than 1 character” is ambiguous (multiple attackers vs. multiple hits vs. another rule term).]]
  2. In form of expression: even if there is a hideous wound on your abdomen and the intestines flow out, you only need to wash the intestines and stuff them back, and the wound will heal.
- **Sequence 6:** Instead, restore 2d6 hit points each time.

### Night Vision

- **Effect:** You have a normal range of vision in the dark, but you still need a certain amount of low light to achieve this effect; **Night Vision** cannot work in completely dark places.

### Fast Dodge

- **Effect:** For firearms, you get full agility and dodge defense.
- **Additional rule:** When you face guns instead of light/lightning, you retain full physical defense and get 1 extra level of dodge.
  - (For extra dodge, see [[LINK LATER: Defense and Dodge Types | type=mechanic | hint=extra dodge level rules]].)

### Hair Armor

- **Effect:** Your armor +3; gain 5 points of cold resistance.
- **Limits:** Cannot be superimposed with other armor.
- **Fire damage:** If you take fire damage, **Hair Armor** does not apply to resist.

### Spiritual Curse

- **Effect:** Unless you are a person higher than you, whether you are transformed or not, any [[LINK LATER: Divination | type=mechanic | hint=divination methods]] and psychic means can only see a figure covered in black hair, and cannot see your true face.
- **Higher Sequence level:** When you obtain a new form, it will affect the abilities of divination and psychic communication, and the presented form will also become the characteristics of your new form.
  1. For example, a [[LINK LATER: Living Corpse | type=sequence | hint=form example]] will see a figure indistinguishable from a human but filled with a gloomy aura, making it impossible to see its face clearly; while a [[LINK LATER: Ghost | type=term | hint=form example]] will only see a face that is transparent as if it does not exist, or a face covered by darkness.
  2. If you commit crimes in the previous heterogeneous form at a higher Sequence level, then the divination will also reveal the previous image.

### Partial Transformation

- **Use:** 1 **Swift Action**; 1 time per round.
- **Effect:**
  1. You gain 1 of the above traits, which does not require a [[LINK LATER: Sanity Rolls | type=mechanic | hint=sanity check procedure]].
  2. Partial transformation can also be used to adjust in reverse. For example, if you become a werewolf but don’t want to be conspicuous because of the werewolf’s appearance, you can use partial transformation to cancel **Hair Armor**, which will also make you lose the benefit of **Hair Armor**.
- **Sequence 6:**
  - Even if you become a living corpse, you can use partial transformation to gain the benefits of a werewolf, gain some of the characteristics of a werewolf, or use the ability of a living corpse under the appearance of a werewolf.
  - However, the Strength, Physique, and Agility bonuses brought by the werewolf itself can only be obtained by completely turning into a werewolf.
  - If you become a werewolf at all, you will lose the [[LINK LATER: Power of the Undead | type=mechanic | hint=lost upon werewolf transformation]], the [[LINK LATER: Skin of Steel | type=mechanic | hint=lost upon werewolf transformation]], and not including the [[LINK LATER: Control of Decay and Cold | type=mechanic | hint=excluded upon werewolf transformation]].
  - Note: Although it is possible to do this while in the [[LINK LATER: Wraith State | type=condition | hint=state mentioned in RAW]], it is meaningless, because the Wraith can't deal physical damage even if it gets the benefit of the werewolf.
- **Sequence 4:** Some transformations can still be used in the [[LINK LATER: Puppet State | type=condition | hint=state mentioned in RAW]].

### Spiritual Alienation

- **Effect:** Because you often satisfy your desire to kill during the full moon, your spirit has become alienated.
- **Limits (who gains this):** This is a side note; only xenos that consistently indulge themselves on most full moon nights will get this effect.
- **While possessing Spiritual Alienation:**
  1. The holder’s will attribute will continue to be temporarily -2, and all sanity checks will be +4 disadvantageous.
  2. Because sanity appraisal is the opposite of normal appraisal—the larger the value of normal appraisal, the better, and the smaller the value of sanity appraisal, the better—this more easily leads to loss of control.
- **Extra:** When possessing Spiritual Alienation, every 1 hour of behavior of indulging self-desire will restore 1 point of sanity. What form this behavior takes depends on your own values.
  > **GM Note:** An Extraordinary with Spiritual Alienation will inevitably become more ruthless, more distorted, and gradually lose the emotions that normal humans should have.
- **Remove Spiritual Alienation:** If you do not release yourself on three full moon nights in a row, you will not be affected by Spiritual Alienation temporarily. However, once you release yourself on any subsequent full moon night to satisfy your desire to kill, you will fall into a state of Spiritual Alienation again.

### Full Moon Curse

- **Effect:** The moon will curse you.
- **Limits:** The Curse of the Full Moon is an inherent effect once one possesses the power of a werewolf, and cannot be recorded or stolen.
- **Under the full moon:**
  1. Your madness has only one kind—violent tendency—and the desire for killing and bloodthirsty will reach its peak.
  2. When being illuminated by the full moon, you must pass a will test with a **Difficulty Value** of 15 every round; otherwise you will automatically become a werewolf, and the corresponding sanity will be deducted. Until you leave the full moon, you will fall into madness and start killing and bloodthirsty.
     - **If you don't:** You lose an action each round, are excruciatingly painful, and don't gain the benefit of insane immediate actions from full moon madness. [[UNCLEAR: “If you don't” is ambiguous (fail the will test vs. refuse another option); phrasing preserved.]]
- **Sedatives:** If you take sedatives (1–2 pills), you don’t need to suppress the madness and you can act normally, but the same kind will be invalid after 4 doses.
- When a new full moon curse is acquired, the original full moon curse will be overwritten.
