# Sequence 4: Puppet

You can manipulate inanimate objects within a certain range.

## Advancement

- **Advancement Ritual:** Requires a Demigod Mummy.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +3, Will +2, Charisma +1; Occultism increases by 1 level.

### The Source of the Curse

- **Cost:** 4 spirituality points.
- **Use:**
  - Use a **free action** to transform into an extremely delicate humanoid puppet.
  - Use a **spellcasting action** to create a dispellable curse relationship with a target.
  - Turning off the damage-sharing aspect is an unlimited number of **free actions**; turning it on is also a **free action** (does not affect an already-established bond).
- **Effect:**
  - **Puppet transformation (free action):**
    - You appear as if crafted by a world-class craftsman.
    - Charm +3 and Physique +3.
    - You are regarded as a [[fallen creature]].
    - You gain part of the abilities of [[Soul Control]] and [[Indestructible Body]] of [[Ghosts]] and [[Zombies]].
    - You additionally gain **The Source of the Curse**.
    - You do **not** inherit the biological types and resistances of ghosts and zombies.
    - **Note:** The deformed appearance can be adjusted; it does not have to be a puppet (it can be a mysterious puppet, a magical paper man, or other items).
  - **Creating the curse relationship (spellcasting action, 4 spirituality points):**
    - You must either (a) obtain the target’s hair or flesh, or (b) perform a [[Ghost Possession]] in advance.
    - The shared effect cannot be resisted by [[Curse Resistance]] or [[Curse Reduction]].
    - If a target is completely immune to curse damage, **The Source of the Curse** can still cause the target to suffer **half of the shared damage unilaterally**.
      - **Note:** This is half **shared damage**, not half **cursed damage**; damage immunity remains immune as usual.
    - If you are one **Sequence** level higher than the opponent, you can inflict the full Source of the Curse effect even against complete curse immunity.
- **Targeting and range:**
  - Target is the creature you form a curse relationship with.
  - Once the connection is established, if it is not isolated, the target is usually affected even if it flees “to the ends of the earth.”
- **Limits:**
  - Two ways to meet the curse condition:
    1) **Ghost possession:** If you carry out a ghost possession of the target, regardless of whether the opponent breaks free, as long as the result of possession is achieved, the curse condition can be continuously met within one [[Encounter]].
    2) **Hair or flesh/blood:** You must properly preserve the hair and flesh/blood, and it must not have suffered severe natural weathering.
       - It is feasible to use a fresh blood sample collected a long time ago.
       - It is not feasible to use skin shed when it fell off, or hair that fell off a long time ago.
    - A kind of flesh and blood is consumed after being used.
  - Any armor and damage reduction other than the target’s body itself are ignored for the doubled body-to-body sharing effect; you can turn off damage sharing in time.
- **Duration:**
  - A connection (whether established by possession or by flesh/blood) can last up to **two hours**.
- **Aftereffects / Ongoing sharing rules:**
  - Your damaged Health and abnormal status continue to be shared with the cursed target.
    - From the moment you become a cursed puppet, all damage and status you receive from each other appear on each other (this interaction is usually ignored unless the GM rules it is relevant).
  - Because the sharing is two-way, your damage is shared with the other party, and the other party’s damage is shared with you; you can switch the damage sharing on/off at any time until the two-hour maintenance time ends (no need to get flesh or possess again).
  - The Health loss caused by sharing is **not** considered curse damage:
    - If the puppet’s self-inflicted damage is physical damage, the shared target also receives physical damage.
    - Lightning damage shares as lightning damage; fire shares as fire; only curse damage uses curse resistance.
    - All damage only benefits from the corresponding damage reduction.
  - The connection does not change the restraint relationship between you:
    - Even if a fallen creature (as a puppet) turns into an undead creature, the additional restraint it receives is still fallen-creature biological damage.
  - The connection does not change either party’s resistances:
    - The target’s lightning/fire resistances do not transfer to you (and vice versa).
    - Resistances and reductions depend on each creature’s own ontology.
  - If you harm others by self-mutilation through damage sharing, you also suffer the corresponding damage. If your remaining Health is less than the cursed person’s, it is likely that you (the caster) will die first.
  - If the attack you suffer comes from voluntarily being hit, and the distance between you is close enough with no external factors, you can choose to skip identifying the attacking skill.
- **Notes:**
  - If you voluntarily accept the attack under the above conditions, then as long as you are in a puppet state, your appearance becomes exactly the same as your cursed target, but this does not affect the essence; your extraordinary ability shows the corresponding effect.
  - **Future Sequence Note:** Sequence 3: You no longer need to self-mutilate; you can replace this substitute attack with the cursed puppet made in advance.
  - **Future Sequence Note:** At Sequence 3 there will be a qualitative change; the current stage belongs to the type that hurts the enemy and also hurts itself.

### Object Activation (Mind Control)

- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points.
- **Use:** A **spellcasting action**.
- **Effect:**
  - On the premise that you become a puppet, one or more inanimate objects within your line of sight that you specify instantly come to life (including enemy clothing).
  - This does not necessarily cause mortal damage to the transcendent, but it briefly binds the target, preventing any action with a [[Postural Component]], except for one free action per turn.
  - If the target tries to escape through their clothing, this can cause them to run naked.
  - Escape requires at least one Strength check (Difficulty Value 20) immediately.
  - Countless flying objects also cause damage at the same time:
    - The damage of environmental items depends on the specific environment.
    - Reference standard: physical damage of 5d6 + Strength damage bonus.
    - Add a number of Strength damage dice equal to your [[Inspiration]].
    - [[Occult]] counters [[Physical Defense]].
    - If restrained, defense cannot gain bonus from agility.
- **Targeting and range:** One or more specified inanimate objects within line of sight; affects the target those objects attack/bind.
- **Limits / Restrictions:**
  - You can attempt similar effects on some items and can try to manipulate [[Extraordinary Items]], but the extraordinary item must be in an inactive, unowned state (not in the owner’s hand at the time, and the item itself is inactive; it can be knocked down nearby).
  - This activation is regarded as a curse and will be nullified by the [[Darknessless Realm]] of [[Sun Path]] Sequence 4.
  - If you are in the state of [[Wronged Soul]], you can still use this skill at this stage; it is the upper version of your mind manipulation ability.
  - This ability can change the aiming direction of firearms and other non-Extraordinary items. If ammunition and shells are around, you can operate them to lift up and kill your target; in short, you can operate almost all non-special items.
  - Using a **free action** once per round, you can turn blood that has just left your body into an independent entity, cutting off its mystical connection with the main body so it cannot be used for divination and cursing.
- **Notes:**
  - **Future Sequence Note:** Sequence 3: You do not have to become a puppet; the ability to manipulate objects is a norm.
  - **Future Sequence Note:** Sequence 1: You can not only activate entities, but also activate things or incorporeal bodies that do not have a specific form.
  - > **GM Note:** RAW suggests that, under certain circumstances (after sufficient early roleplay), this could be used to interfere with a magician’s “flame jump,” turning their flame against them and binding them so they cannot continue to use it. [[Flame Jump]]

### Immortal Body

- **Effect:** Your body heals quickly.
- **Use / Trigger:**
  - Once per round, it triggers automatically whenever your HP reaches 0.
  - **Special (Sequence 4):** You can actively trigger it as a **free action** once per round, consuming the number of passive triggers.
- **Effect (on trigger):**
  - Your Physique is temporarily -3.
  - Restore HP equal to half your maximum Health (rounded up).
  - The Physique reduction can only be paid by you (it cannot be transferred or offset by others).
- **Limits:**
  - If the end of your life is holy damage or lightning damage, it does not trigger Immortal Body.
  - The damage that ends your life must not put you in a dying state; it must directly end your life to be effective.
  - For dying, see [[Special State]].
