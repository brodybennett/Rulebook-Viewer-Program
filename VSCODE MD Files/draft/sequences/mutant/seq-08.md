# [[LINK LATER: Pathway Name | type=pathway | hint=Pathway that contains Sequence 8: Lunatic]] Pathway: Sequence 8

## Lunatic

- You can voluntarily and actively sacrifice your **Sanity** and burst out your desires in exchange for strength, gaining improvements in all aspects.
  - During this time, your mind becomes less clear; this is usually not a big problem, and you may even gain some insight.
- You have strong resistance to extraordinary abilities that interfere with thoughts and affect the spirit.
- From this **Sequence** onwards, the curse emerges gradually, and you are easily out of control.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** strength +1, constitution +1, inspiration +2.
- **Upgrade:** Your [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9 | type=sequence | hint=previous sequence]] potion skills can be upgraded to advanced.

### Crazy Intuitive Action

- **Use:** 1 [[LINK LATER: swift action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]].
- **Cost:** 2 [[LINK LATER: spiritual points | type=mechanic | hint=resource]].
- **Effect:** Choose 1 of the following:
  - You reroll a roll you are currently making, but must initiate an **SC** (1/1d3). [[LINK LATER: SC | type=mechanic | hint=check tied to Sanity]]
  - Whenever you fail, you immediately get an [[LINK LATER: attack action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] or [[LINK LATER: spellcasting action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] of your choice.
- **Limits:** The “whenever you fail” option can only be used once per round and cannot be superimposed by similar abilities.
- **Aftereffects:** If you lose **Sanity**, or are in a state of **insanity**, you gain +1 to all stats and your attack actions deal an extra 1d6 physical damage until Sanity is restored, 24 hours have elapsed, or a [[LINK LATER: long rest | type=mechanic | hint=rest rules]] has elapsed.
- **Special:** While insane, **thoughts-disturbing** and **mind-affecting** abilities, good or bad, take a -4 penalty on you.
  - This only includes disturbing auxiliary types of psychic abilities, such as [[LINK LATER: dragon power | type=mechanic | hint=psychic ability]], [[LINK LATER: frenzy | type=mechanic | hint=psychic ability]], and [[LINK LATER: dreaming | type=mechanic | hint=psychic ability]] (awakening +4 is beneficial), but does not include effects that directly cause [[LINK LATER: psychic damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]], such as [[LINK LATER: psychic piercing | type=mechanic | hint=psychic damage effect]].

> **GM Note:** For a sensible reply, see [[LINK LATER: Chapter Three: Attributes | type=other | hint=rulebook chapter]] and [[LINK LATER: Attributes | type=mechanic | hint=attribute definitions and handling]].

### Full Moon Curse

- **Effect:** The Curse of the Full Moon is an inherent effect once possessing the ability of a madman and cannot be recorded or stolen. [[LINK LATER: madman | type=term | hint=term used in this ruleset]]
- **Trigger:** When you are illuminated by a full moon, you immediately take an **SC** (1/1d3) that does not retrigger, and you become vulnerable to [[LINK LATER: loss of control | type=condition | hint=control rules]].
- **Easy to Lose Control:**
  - You gain a +2 bonus on **Sanity checks**. [[LINK LATER: Sanity checks | type=mechanic | hint=check resolution]]
  - rd20s on Sanity checks of 18, 19, or 20 are considered catastrophic failures. [[UNCLEAR: "rd20s" is undefined here (likely intended to indicate d20 rolls), but it changes how Sanity checks resolve.]]
- **Special:** When acquiring a new full moon curse, the original full moon curse will be overwritten.
