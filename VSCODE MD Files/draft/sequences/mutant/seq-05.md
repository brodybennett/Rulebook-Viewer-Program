# Sequence 5: Wraith

## Wraith

You can transform your state into a real shadow and gain corresponding abilities, including passing through obstacles, hiding in mirrors, directly attacking an opponent’s soul, and jumping to most places where images can be reflected.

Unlike ordinary [[LINK LATER: Resentful Soul | type=term | hint=undead spirit state/creature type]], even if they have [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Vision | type=mechanic | hint=vision mode]], they cannot find this kind of ghost without a high-Sequence.

You also master many death-like spells and weird skills, such as forcibly possessing a body and controlling an enemy.

> **Lore:** Promotion into a Wraith brings out deep obsessions and strange, deathlike powers that blur the line between shadow and spirit.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Let all your obsessions and desires be suppressed; even a little bit of desire-related thoughts should be kept as far as possible, and promotion is carried out in this state. (Unofficial ceremony)

### Essence

When being promoted to a [[LINK LATER: Resentful Soul | type=term | hint=promotion stage mentioned here]], the **Extraordinary** will forcefully burst out all the obsessions in their heart. They must fight with the opposite emotion; otherwise, the Extraordinary becomes a real resentful soul.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +1, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
- Your Mysticism can be quickly upgraded to knowledgeable.
- The potion skill of Sequence 9 can be quickly upgraded to proficient.

### Sequence Traits and Overrides

1. Becoming a Wraith overwrites the resident undead effect of the [[LINK LATER: Zombie Stage | type=sequence | hint=prior stage with resident undead effect]].
2. From now on, as long as you don’t become a ghost, your life form is considered normal and will not receive additional restraint effects; you are still considered undead when you use it. [[UNCLEAR: “it” and the state change being referenced are not explicitly identified.]]
3. You don’t need to consume actions to activate your original ability, but the ability of the [[LINK LATER: Living Corpse | type=mechanic | hint=ability/state from earlier stage]] is contradictory to the state of the resentful soul, and it cannot be used when it is a spirit body. [[UNCLEAR: “it” and whether “spirit body” refers to shadow form or another state is not explicitly defined.]]

### Full Moon Curse

**Full Moon Curse**: Your madness comes with a thirst for souls.

The Curse of the Full Moon is an inherent effect once one has the ability of a Wraith, and cannot be recorded or stolen.

1. Under the full moon, you immediately fall into violent madness and thirst for soul.
2. Unlike the previous full moon curse, in the Wraith stage, if you are exposed to the full moon, you must start to suck people’s souls.

- **If you don’t:** You can only use 1 swift action per round, and 1 cast/attack/move action; you become extremely weak, can only collapse on the ground, and return from Wraith to human form, no longer enjoying the benefits and traits of Wraiths.

Resentful souls who do not consume souls for a long time become weak immediately under the full moon. Resentful souls who often consume souls go crazy first and completely lose their minds; the latter will also fall into a weakened state if the goal is not reached within 1 hour.

If you suck human souls, you can continue to maintain your normal actions by sucking at least 5 human souls.

### Shapeshifting Shadow

- **Use:** Transform into a shadow as a swift action.
- **Effect:** You become a shadow. In shadow form:
  - You are treated as an undead creature.
  - You gain +3 to Inspiration and Dexterity.
  - You gain **Incorporeal Characteristics** and access to: **Wraith Scream**, **Mirror Jump**, **Advanced Shadow Invisibility**, **Death Skeleton**, **Wraith Possession**, **Devour Soul**, **Mind Control**.

**Incorporeal Characteristics** (while in shadow form):

- You cannot cause physical damage, and you will not receive physical damage.
- You only receive holy damage, spiritual damage, lightning damage, and curse damage.
- Cold damage is halved and rounded up.
- You have 5 points of resistance to curse damage.
- You have night vision; night vision cannot work in places without a trace of light.

Additional notes (while in shadow form):

1. The halving effect is a kind of damage reduction.
2. Incorporeal is not an Extraordinary ability; it is an explanation of **Shapeshifting Shadow**. If **Shapeshifting Shadow** is lost, Incorporeal also disappears.
3. You can fly; speed equals your movement force. You can pass through objects, and you can still perform special actions even if you cannot cause physical damage.
4. **Special:** In the state of resentment, you can store items in your body, and you can keep the state of resentment without eating for two weeks.
5. The number of items that can be stored in your body equals your Constitution. Your body temperature is quite cold. You can actively create a cold wind without any obvious effect without any action, to scare people or show your existence.
6. Wraith form has no physical vital points, so it cannot be critically hit by other paths other than the [[LINK LATER: Death Path | type=pathway | hint=referenced as exception to critical hits]].

Extra (while in shadow form):

- You can find the location of the [[LINK LATER: Spirit World | type=location | hint=otherworld plane]] and enter it, or come out of it in about 1 minute.
- You don’t have the ability to shuttle at high speed in the spirit world, but you usually won’t get lost.
- Because of the time required, this ability is often ineffective in combat.

Higher-Sequence note:

- **Sequence 2:** You can travel through the spirit world in the spirit world, and you must first enter the spirit world to take effect. [[UNCLEAR: The exact meaning of “travel through the spirit world in the spirit world” is unclear as written.]]

### Advanced Shadow Invisibility

- **Prerequisite:** You are in shadow form (from **Shapeshifting Shadow**).
- **Effect:** Spirit visions other than [[LINK LATER: Eye of Mystery | type=term | hint=special vision]], [[LINK LATER: Reaper | type=term | hint=special vision or class]], and [[LINK LATER: Master Puppet | type=term | hint=special vision or class]] cannot discover your location.
- **Use:** As a swift action, you can actively reveal yourself so others can observe you.

Notes:

1. If you receive holy damage or lightning damage, you appear briefly and need a swift action to re-invisibility.
2. If you want to take something while in the Wraith state, you also need to show your body; you don’t need to simply speak. [[UNCLEAR: “you don’t need to simply speak” is unclear as a rule statement.]]
3. It’s not that you can’t touch the item without being visible, but because the item is not invisible.
4. If you take it directly, others will see something floating out of thin air; it is not considered part of your body and will not become invisible with you the moment you touch it.
5. Therefore, this reveals your location. If you first remove invisibility, get the item, and then invisibility, it is regarded as part of you and disappears with you. If you place an item instead of taking it, you can make it appear out of thin air without being visible.

Special detection clause:

- If there is a target larger than you by one person, then even if it is not a special vision, it can still find you. [[UNCLEAR: “larger than you by one person” is not clearly defined.]]
- If you are possessed or hidden in objects or creatures, you can still avoid this kind of detection, only ordinary vision.
- If attached to an object, it may be more secure to cover the object with a [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Wall | type=mechanic | hint=protective barrier]].

### Wraith Scream

- **Prerequisite:** You are in shadow form (from **Shapeshifting Shadow**).
- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points.
- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Effect:** Inflicts 1/1d3 Sanity loss to a creature hearing the scream for the first time in an encounter, and stuns it for 1 round.

### Mirror Jump

- **Prerequisite:** You are in shadow form (from **Shapeshifting Shadow**).
- **Effect:** You can freely enter and exit the mirror, and use the mirror to help you resist attacks.

1. **Passive:** Shuttle in the mirror image, retain complete physical defense against firearms instead of light/lightning, and gain an extra level of dodge. [[UNCLEAR: The passive defense tradeoff “against firearms instead of light/lightning” is unclear as written.]]
2. **Active:** 1 swift action, 1 time per round: choose a mirror within 300 meters to perform a mirror jump. You can avoid the attack aimed at your original position. Range attack requires you to jump out of the corresponding range, just like a [[LINK LATER: Flame Jump | type=mechanic | hint=teleport/evade reference]].

Perception and definition notes:

- You can perceive the position of mirrors within 300 meters, but this is not specific. For example, you cannot appear on an enemy out of thin air at a distance of 300 meters.
- The definition of a mirror image includes some reflective things, including lenses. Without these, you cannot use this ability.

### Wraith Possession

- **Prerequisite:** You are in shadow form (from **Shapeshifting Shadow**).
- **Use:** A move action that selects an animate or inanimate object.
- **Targeting and range:** You can possess a target within a range of 30 meters, which is considered as a casting action. [[UNCLEAR: The action type for possession at range conflicts with the stated “move action.”]]

Process notes:

1. The movement action is expressed as normal floating past, overlapping with the body of the possessed person.
2. Possession within 30 meters is considered a casting action.

**Possession status** (while you are possessing):

- The possessor can use the opponent’s body, display the opponent’s ability, and perform actions with the opponent’s body.
- The possessor can only use their own attack, spellcasting, movement, swiftness, and free actions to control the opponent’s body when possessing.
  - Example: If a resentful spirit uses a move action to possess a target, then even if already possessing the target, their own move action is still lost, and they do not gain the target’s move action.
  - If the possessed target has an ability or effect that can increase extra actions, the possessor can also enjoy it.

**Possessed state** (effects on the possessed target):

- The possessed target cannot perform attack and movement actions, cannot speak, and loses control of its own body.
- It can use a swift action to extend its spirituality every round to perform a spell-casting action.
- The figure of the possessed creature (whole body) will appear in the two pupils of the possessed creature.

Limits on what can be used while possessed:

- Being able to cast spells does not mean you can cast swift/free actions.
  - Examples: the [[LINK LATER: Midnight Poet | type=term | hint=class/sequence]]’s chanting must be voluntary; the [[LINK LATER: Fool | type=term | hint=class/sequence]]’s flame jump must snap fingers or simulate snapping; the air cannon needs speech.
- Therefore, in the possessed state, only abilities that do not require physical movements can be used at all. Spell-casting actions performed through extended spirituality usually do not require physical movements; if a verbal or physical action is clearly required, it cannot be used.

Getting out of the possession state:

- To get out, you must use special means to counter the extraordinary ability with extraordinary ability.
- Mental influence (such as painful torture), holy attack, and lightning attack are effective means, but generally cause damage to both the possessed and the possessor; mental influence may be offset by crazy actions.
- Teleporting or transforming one’s own form of existence (such as [[LINK LATER: Moonlighting | type=mechanic | hint=form/teleport reference]]) cannot get rid of the resentful spirit, because the spirit body is deeply bound.
- Because possessor and possessed have independent actions, you can continue to use any remaining actions after breaking away from possession.

Possession description limits:

- When you possess a creature or an inanimate object, you cannot do things that the creature or object would not otherwise be able to do.
  - Example: Possessing a person does not let you twist their head 180 degrees without external force, but you can strangle them with their hands or beat them.
  - Possession does not change the possessed target’s attributes (e.g., it doesn’t enable a 10-meter jump).
  - You can attach a carriage to make it run without a horse, and attach a camera to shock parts so there is no flash.

Special:

- If possessing the corpse of an Extraordinary, the resentful soul can accelerate the precipitation of Extraordinary characteristics, turning five minutes into one minute.

> **GM Note:** The text suggests prevention measures (e.g., “summon the full moon” or “prepare a substitute”) but does not fully define these as mechanics; treat them cautiously unless defined elsewhere.

### Devour Soul

- **Prerequisite:** You are in shadow form (from **Shapeshifting Shadow**), unless stated otherwise.
- **Effect (on kill):** Whenever you kill a creature, you can consume its soul as a swift action, restoring 1d8 spirituality.

Special use (against an ethereal body):

- **Cost:** 1 spirituality point.
- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Effect:** You stretch out your left hand forward and let out an invisible scream from your mouth. Choose 1 ethereal body; this is usually only effective against ethereal creatures without extraordinary qualities.
  1. The ground suddenly becomes black like a muddy deep sea; a twisted blood-colored vine grows out of it, divided into many sections; each section has four fangs and one eye.
  2. The vine grows wildly, fixes the chosen spirit body, sucks 1d8 life every round, and transforms it into your spirit until it dies.
  3. The spirit can break free with a Difficulty Value 20 Strength check.

- This ability can be used to extract spirits possessed by other people, excluding resentful souls of the same level as you.

Higher-Sequence notes:

- **Sequence 4:** You can directly pull out the spirit body possessed by others without summoning vines, but this does not have the effects of binding and sucking, and devouring the soul of a person lower than you will not fall into temporary madness.
- **Sequence 2:** 1 spell-casting action, consuming 3 spirituality points: you open your mouth, take a breath in, blow a cold wind, and forcibly pull the enemy’s spirit body.
  - Occult minus -10 is unfavorable against its will defense, causing 6d6 mental damage, and making it unable to maintain a state and possession that are difficult for others to see.
  - For spirit bodies that are two lower than yours, you can directly pull them out and swallow.
  - In this way, you can now also accommodate as many objects as hills directly into your body (such as tens of thousands of gold coins).

### Mind Manipulation

- **Prerequisite:** You are in shadow form (from **Shapeshifting Shadow**).
- **Effect:** You make objects levitate out of thin air and control objects to kill opponents.
- **Targeting and resolution:** Occult attacks physical defense.
- **Damage:** Deal 4d6 + Strength damage bonus physical damage; treat your Inspiration as Strength damage dice. [[UNCLEAR: “treat your Inspiration as Strength damage dice” is not fully specified (conversion method not stated).]]

### Spirit World Divination

- **Prerequisite:** You are in the state of a wronged soul. [[UNCLEAR: “wronged soul” is not clearly defined; likely refers to a resentful soul/wraith state.]]
- **Effect:** You can directly obtain the information you want through the [[LINK LATER: Spirit World | type=location | hint=divination medium]].
- **Special:** Usually, you don’t need tarot cards or coins as a medium to directly obtain information.

Difficulty outcomes:

- **Difficulty Value 15:** Get a very general result (e.g., finding objects only tells you a city).
- **Difficulty Value 20:** Get a more general result, usually a general direction.
- **Difficulty Value 25:** Obtain a fairly accurate result (object finding accurate to a certain street).
- **Difficulty Value 30:** Obtain a very accurate result; divination reveals a specific content.

Resolution notes:

- **Identification failure:** Repeated divination only gets the same result; you need new clues to divinate again.
- **Great success:** Results are extremely accurate: specific content, and the time, place, and people are revealed.
- **Big failure:** You still obtain corresponding content according to the final value of the appraisal, but attract the attention of related beings. If the content did not involve hidden beings, directly or indirectly related Extraordinary notice being watched.

Detection note:

- Aware of the gaze requires a [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition Test | type=mechanic | hint=awareness check]]; the existence of higher than 1 person is detected by default regardless of the difficulty. [[UNCLEAR: “higher than 1 person” is unclear.]]

Special repetition clause:

- Before obtaining new clues, repeated divination in the same direction only gets the same result, regardless of difficulty.

Other divination factors:

1. Divination involving other people fails by default if there is no clue, and succeeds by default if there is their blood or belongings.
2. For each clue obtained, divination related events are +2 beneficial, but divination of targets higher than 1 character fails by default. [[UNCLEAR: “higher than 1 character” is unclear (level/Sequence?).]]
3. The reason for detection and failure of the higher level is that under special circumstances, it is possible for the lower level to divinate for the higher level.
4. Whenever you are in a deep sleep, you can conduct an Inspiration appraisal with a Difficulty Value 20. If it succeeds, and something directly related to you has happened in the current period, you will see a general picture that needs to be interpreted. This is the first step of dream interpretation.

### Anti-Divination

As some kind of spiritual creature, your own existence comes with anti-divination.

- **Effect:** Your Inspiration + Will + Mysticism bonus is regarded as the Difficulty Value of divination against you. Divinations that do not exceed this Difficulty Value only get wrong information.

### Death Spells

You have mastered some death spells, or improved upon your previous death spells.

#### Manipulate Ghosts

- It belongs to the sequence improvement of [[LINK LATER: Manipulating Living Corpses | type=mechanic | hint=prior spell/ability]].
- **Cost:** 3 spirit points. [[UNCLEAR: “spirit points” may be the same as “spirituality points,” but the text uses both terms.]]
- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Targeting:** Choose 1 corpse that has not been dead for more than 24 hours (spirit body still in the body / not requiemed), or an existing wandering shadow, and manipulate it as your puppet.

Shadow statistics:

- **Health:** 15
- **Physical defense:** 15 (5 points for agility and dodge)
- **Will defense:** 10

Shadow traits:

1. Shadow has 5 points of resistance to cold and curse, ignores poison and physical damage, and causes 1d6 cold damage when attacking; it does not have more abilities, and can perform special actions such as grapple.
2. Shadow does not have other special abilities. It can also pass through obstacles and has incorporeal characteristics, but it does not have the abilities of Wraith possession/screaming and so on.

Control notes:

- The undead creatures driven by you are not equal to [[LINK LATER: Secret Puppets | type=term | hint=distinct undead/puppet category]] and may not necessarily share senses.
- You can use your thoughts to give them orders within 100 meters without moving; they complete the orders even if they leave the range.

#### Death Skull

- **Cost:** 2 spirituality points.
- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Effect:** Create a black skull exuding a strong breath of death; it runs toward the opponent with strong death intent like an emissary sent by the underworld.
- **Damage:** 5d6+5 curse damage.
