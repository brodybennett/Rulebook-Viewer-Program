# Sequence 2: Ancient Bane

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Bring back a “dead” who was at least 300 years ago, and use them as the main body to create a curse that sweeps the whole city or affects more than a thousand people, passed down from generation to generation.

> **GM Note:** The RAW labels the following as an “unofficial ceremony.”  
> In the second half, it is also feasible to take away all the dead bodies or cursed people, transfer all the curses they carry to yourself, let yourself bear the curse, and take the potion.  
> [[UNCLEAR: Whether this “unofficial ceremony” is permitted by default or only with GM approval.]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +2, Agility +1, Strength +2, Inspiration +1, and your Occultism goes up by one level.

### Reverse Inhalation of Spirit Bodies

- **Use:** Open your mouth and take a breath in.
- **Effect:** You can blow a cold wind that forcibly pulls the enemy’s spirit body, making it impossible to maintain a state and possession that are difficult for others to see.

### Ancient Evil

- **Effect:** You can’t die completely by preparing ahead of time.
- **Use:** As a full-round action, you enter the Spirit World in the state of a wronged soul and set an early anchor point in the Spirit World in advance.
- **Limits:**
  - You can have only one anchor point (upper limit 1).
  - When you die, you can abandon your physical body and be reincarnated in the Spirit World as a spirit creature.
  - This requires you to prepare a Sequence 2 extraordinary characteristic of the same level for your new spirit body in advance; only then can reincarnation be completed. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW sentence is fragmented; this is the safest faithful reading.]]

> **Lore:** After reincarnation, although your appearance is still human, your body will have the alienation of Spirit World creatures. For example, there will be no more head on the neck, but your head will become four. When you usually move, you need to lift up two heads and let them speak separately.

- **Aftereffects (Unrecovered State):**
  - After becoming this state, although you are still an angel, you will not be able to make any waves for a long time.
  - Each time you use any ability of a demigod or above, you suffer a **(1/1d3) rationality test**; this is required every time you use such an ability. [[UNCLEAR: The meaning of “(1/1d3) rationality test” is not defined here (difficulty vs. loss vs. other).]]
    - **Exception:** This does not include (a) the activation of objects based on the power of wronged souls, or (b) the Reverse Inhalation of Spirit Bodies of Sequence 2, because both are based on the upper version of wronged souls of Sequence 5 and are essentially Sequence 5 abilities; they are not affected.
  - The madness brought about can be avoided by crazy actions, but at the same time you can no longer continue to open the mythical form.
    - Opening the mythical form causes you to suffer a sanity test equivalent to your Sequence promotion—i.e., the sanity test you suffered when you promoted to Sequence 2.
  - This does not affect you just changing the appearance of a giant rag doll; just changing to a mythical appearance without the influence of mythical runes is fine, but you will not get any benefits of mythical form.
  - In the unrecovered state, you can only remain in the state of a ghost and cannot transform into a werewolf, a living corpse, or even a puppet.

- **Recovery:**
  - The way to get you back is to take back your old body. No matter what it is now, angelic bodies usually don’t get corrupted over time; take your whole body back and you can reassemble your original body of yourself.
