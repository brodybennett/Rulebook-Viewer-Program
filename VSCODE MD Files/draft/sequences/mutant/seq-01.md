# Sequence 1: Abomination

## Abomination

> **GM Note:** This Sequence is described as inducing mental blankness in surrounding creatures through roaring, while also risking erosion and curses even without directly attacking. It also describes a decreasing fit between body and soul, with the body becoming a “cage” that makes movement increasingly stiff and heavy. [[LINK LATER: Erosion | type=condition | hint=corruption/mental/physical degradation system]] [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=mechanic | hint=curse rules and effects]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Directly affect a being who is near or already a deity by corrupting or cursing. (unofficial ceremony) [[UNCLEAR: “near” may mean physically near or “close to becoming” a deity; the ritual target condition is ambiguous.]] [[LINK LATER: Deity | type=term | hint=divinity/deity rules]] [[LINK LATER: Corruption | type=mechanic | hint=corruption rules]] [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=mechanic | hint=curse application rules]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +2, Dexterity +1, Strength +2, Inspiration +1

### Abominable State

- **Use:** As a **Free Action**, you transform into an abomination.
- **Effect:**
  - You gain all the benefits of previous shapeshifting abilities. [[LINK LATER: Shapeshifting | type=mechanic | hint=prior transformation abilities and benefits]]
  - All enemies around you gain +2 to the final result of **Sanity** rolls. [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=mechanic | hint=sanity checks/rolls and effects]]
  - While in the abomination state, the sanity test you suffer will eventually deduct half of the sanity value (rounded up). [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear what “deduct half of the sanity value” is deducted from (current Sanity, maximum Sanity, test result, or damage/loss from the test).]]
- **Targeting and range:** “All enemies around you.” [[LINK LATER: Around You | type=mechanic | hint=rules definition for proximity/area wording]]
- **Limits:**
  - Note: The state of Shenpin is like a werewolf, supporting only part of the body to deform. [[LINK LATER: Shenpin State | type=condition | hint=partial transformation state]]

> **Lore:** In this state, limbs may suddenly lengthen; the surface becomes dark and sticky as if flowing with a strange liquid; pale skulls, bloodshot eyeballs, and fanged tongues can appear, rapidly diffusing an aura of extreme evil and madness that dries the surroundings and taints others’ consciousness, making effective response impossible for a short time.

### The Body Is the Cage of the Mind, and the World Is the Cage of the Body

- **Cost:** 3 **spirituality points**. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource/spend rules]]
- **Use:** A **Spellcasting Action**; you must be in the abomination state.
- **Effect:**
  - You make a **Mysticism** attack against the **Will Defense** of all targets in the field; the attack check is -15 disadvantageous. [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=mechanic | hint=mysticism attack rules]] [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense/contest rules]] [[LINK LATER: Field | type=mechanic | hint=area-of-effect definition]]
  - You can also use **Fighting** against **Physical Defense**, ignoring **armor**, to use this ability. [[LINK LATER: Fighting | type=mechanic | hint=melee/attack method rules]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat rules]] [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=item | hint=armor rules and interactions]]
  - Fighting against style does not have adverse penalties.
  - Partially deformed gods can only use Fighting to display this ability. [[LINK LATER: Partially Deformed | type=condition | hint=partial transformation limitations]] [[LINK LATER: Deity | type=term | hint=divinity/deity rules]]
  - As for how to fight remotely, you can make your arms suddenly grow and reach enemies hundreds of meters away.
  - Enemies who continue to hear your roar or are touched by your body receive the following effects:
    - **First stage:** Only one **Free Action** and one **Action** can be performed; the spirit body begins to lose fit with the body gradually.
    - **Second stage:** Only one **Action** can be performed; the body begins to gradually become a cage of the heart.
    - **Third stage:** It takes two turns to perform a **Free Action**, and three turns to perform an **Action**.
    - **Fourth stage:** Unable to perform any actions; the world becomes a cage of the body, and the body becomes a cage of the mind.
    - [[UNCLEAR: The method/timing for progressing between stages (and whether stages reset) is not specified.]]
  - Even if the Will Defense confrontation is unsuccessful, it can directly interrupt ongoing unfinished actions (such as actions that require a round of time), making their brains suddenly blank and losing all thoughts for a short time. [[LINK LATER: Interrupted Action | type=mechanic | hint=interrupt rules for multi-round actions]]
- **Targeting and range:**
  - “All targets in the field.”
  - Continued hearing of the roar or being touched by your body applies the staged effects.

### Curse Damage Bypasses the Double

- **Effect:** From now on, any **curse damage** you deal will pass through the **double** and cannot be directly saved by the double. [[LINK LATER: Curse Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type and mitigation rules]] [[LINK LATER: Double | type=mechanic | hint=duplicate/substitute mechanic; how it “saves” damage]]
