> **Lore:** In this state, limbs may suddenly lengthen; the surface becomes dark and sticky as if flowing with a strange liquid; pale skulls, bloodshot eyeballs, and fanged tongues can appear, rapidly diffusing an aura of extreme evil and madness that dries the surroundings and taints others’ consciousness, making effective response impossible for a short time.

```




- **Cost:** 3 **spirituality points**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** A **Spellcasting Action**; you must be in the abomination state.
- **Effect:**
  - You make a **Mysticism** attack against the **Willpower Defense** of all targets in the field; the attack check is -15 disadvantageous. [[Mysticism]] Willpower Defense [[Field]]
  - You can also use **Fighting** against **Physical Defense**, ignoring **armor**, to use this ability. [[Fighting]] [[Physical Defense]] [[Armor]]
  - Fighting against style does not have adverse penalties.
  - Partially deformed gods can only use Fighting to display this ability. [[Partially Deformed]] [[Deity]]
  - As for how to fight remotely, you can make your arms suddenly grow and reach enemies hundreds of meters away.
  - Enemies who continue to hear your roar or are touched by your body receive the following effects:
    - **First stage:** Only one **Free Action** and one **Action** can be performed; the spirit body begins to lose fit with the body gradually.
    - **Second stage:** Only one **Action** can be performed; the body begins to gradually become a cage of the heart.
    - **Third stage:** It takes two turns to perform a **Free Action**, and three turns to perform an **Action**.
    - **Fourth stage:** Unable to perform any actions; the world becomes a cage of the body, and the body becomes a cage of the mind.
    - **Stage progression:** Each round of continued exposure advances the stage by 1; stages reset when the exposure ends.
  - Even if the Willpower Defense confrontation is unsuccessful, it can directly interrupt ongoing unfinished actions (such as actions that require a round of time), making their brains suddenly blank and losing all thoughts for a short time. [[Interrupted Action]]
- **Targeting and range:**
  - “All targets in the field.”
  - Continued hearing of the roar or being touched by your body applies the staged effects.

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
