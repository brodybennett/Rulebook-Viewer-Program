# Sequence 3: Disciple of Silence

## Disciple of Silence

- See also: [[LINK LATER: Pathway of Disciple of Silence | type=pathway | hint=Exact Pathway name not provided in RAW]]

[[UNCLEAR: Source uses both “Disciple of Silence” and “Silent Disciple”; unclear if these refer to the same Sequence title or distinct terms.]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual (Unofficial):** Let yourself be a puppet in the true sense—do nothing and move nothing—but under this premise, let a demigod or a large number of civilians around die due to the curse unknowingly. At the end of the event, take the potion in the epilogue. (unofficial ceremony)
- **Substitute (Unofficial):** Become a pure puppet for 30 years, let your will almost stagnate, and let the surroundings unknowingly change due to your divinity, and finally drink the potion not through your own actions. (unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +2, Dexterity +1, Strength +2, Inspiration +1

### Cursed Thing

- **Effect:** Gain [[LINK LATER: Curse of Transformation | type=mechanic | hint=Transformation curse referenced at Sequence 3]].
- **Curse of Transformation:** It can turn enemies or things into other creatures, and “lose” most of their traits and extraordinary abilities after transformation. [15]

### Source of the Curse

- **Effect:** Your **Source of the Curse** [[LINK LATER: Source of the Curse | type=mechanic | hint=Core curse-casting feature for this Sequence]] no longer requires yourself as a puppet of the curse.
- **Use:** Over 1d3 hours, you craft an elaborate doll by giving it a portion of your own hit points as its hit point limit; the doll can carry up to one. [[UNCLEAR: The doll “can carry up to one” is missing an object (curse/ability/target/etc.).]]
- **Effect:** When performing a curse, you can replace your source of curse skills by damaging the doll, and it also supports disconnecting and connecting curses at any time.
- **Cost (rapid crafting):** Consuming 5 points of spirituality, you can immediately make a doll and use it immediately, as long as you have brought the materials.
- **Limits (hit points vs. spirituality):** If you want, you can also replace its upper limit of health by giving some spirituality, but the health and spirituality given should be at least 1:1, and the health is still the main value.
- **Targeting and range:** When using this doll, your curse no longer necessarily needs a target medium such as flesh and blood. As long as it is within your sight range, you can select a target, change the doll into the other party's appearance, and establish a curse relationship.
- **Extra:** This puppet can be regarded as your substitute, transfer the damage you receive, and can replace some of the abilities of the puppet and the Silent Disciple. That is, you can still use it when you are in the state of [[LINK LATER: Wraith | type=condition | hint=State that normally limits actions/abilities]]. The [[LINK LATER: Silent Curse | type=mechanic | hint=Accumulated curse referenced by name]] you have accumulated cannot be cast through it, but the imposition of the [[LINK LATER: Curse of Silence | type=mechanic | hint=Curse application referenced by name]] can be cast through it until it is destroyed.
- **Limits (granted abilities):** The abilities it uses need to be given by you. In addition to the original puppet stand-in ability, you need to choose **1** puppet or silent disciple's ability to give it to use.

### Transformation Curse

- **Use:** A **spellcasting action** [[LINK LATER: Spellcasting action | type=mechanic | hint=Action type used for casting]].
- **Cost:** 3 points of spirituality.
- **Check:** [[LINK LATER: Occult | type=mechanic | hint=Skill/check used for curses]] against [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=Defense used to resist curses]], at -12 disadvantage.
- **Effect:** You turn a target in sight into an animal. After transformation, it will “lose” most of its characteristics and extraordinary abilities. This is regarded as a curse.
- **Duration:** One encounter. [[LINK LATER: Encounter | type=mechanic | hint=Scene/encounter duration unit]]
- **Manifestation:** Your mouth opens, as if making a silent scream, which can turn the target into another creature.
- **Extra (non-creatures):** It is also valid for non-creatures. For example, you can turn a steam tank into a sheep with a dull expression. The driver will be wrapped in the sheep's body immediately, and then the sheep's belly will pop out, and a driver will appear out of nowhere.

In this reference case, you can create the following animals:
1. Rabbit
2. cat
3. Dogs
4. Niu Niu
5. Pig
6. Goat
7. Sheep
8. Pigeon
9. Squirrel
10. Fish (if at sea)

- **At Sequence 2:** You can use this ability on multiple targets in sight at once, and change it to a [[LINK LATER: Free action | type=mechanic | hint=Action type]] once in 1 round, turning the targets reflected in the eyes into other creatures. There is almost no upper limit for the maintenance time; it cannot be undone without the same level of confrontation or the correct method. [[LINK LATER: Round | type=mechanic | hint=Combat time unit]]

### Extra: Death Path Immunity Limits

- **Effect:** From now on, your curse is still valid for the [[LINK LATER: Death Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Referred to as “death path” in RAW]] of your same level. The curse damage cannot be immune but can only be halved. Not only limited to the curse ability of Sequence 3; it is applicable to all your curse abilities, as long as you reach the Sequence 3.

### Silent Disciple: Ultimate Curse (Long Silence)

- **Effect:** You can brew the ultimate curse in a long silence.
- **Use:** A **spellcasting action** [[LINK LATER: Spellcasting action | type=mechanic | hint=Action type used for casting]]. Choos
