# White Tower Pathway: Sequence 2

## Wisdom Angel

> **Lore:** The Angel of the White Tower Passage.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +3, **Education** +2.
- Increase all **Inspiration**-related skills by 1 level.

### The Temples Come Down

- **Cost:** 10 **Spirituality** each round. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=Resource/points]]
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**. [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=Action types]]
- **Targeting and range:** Covers an area up to 10 kilometers.
- **Effect:** Your **Temple of Knowledge** immediately materializes within the area. [[LINK LATER: Temple of Knowledge | type=term | hint=White Tower ability construct]]  
  Every book within becomes physical (can be touched and read). While you are within the area, you gain all of the following benefits:

1. **Automatic absorption of written/visual knowledge:** Knowledge carriers presented as words, pictures, etc. are automatically read by the Temple at a speed of up to 100 per round. Identical-content books consolidate into bookshelves, and their information is printed immediately into your mind.  
   - **Limit:** Repeated knowledge usually does not improve skills (see [[LINK LATER: Quick Reading | type=mechanic | hint=Sequence 9 ability reference]]).
   - [[UNCLEAR: The “100 per round” reading speed does not specify the unit (page, item, etc.).]]

2. **Default success on non-opposed appraisals:** All skill appraisals that do not involve confrontation, and all **Education** and **Inspiration** attribute appraisals, succeed by default. When confrontation is involved, you gain [[LINK LATER: Advantage | type=mechanic | hint=Core rules]].

3. **Identification modifiers:** Choose any number of friendly units (not including yourself). They gain +2 to **Inspiration**-related identification. All skill identifications made by your enemy units suffer -2.

4. **Wisdom for inactive Extraordinary Items:** Choose 1 or more inactive [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Items | type=item | hint=Core item rules]] to gain wisdom. Whenever a [[LINK LATER: Big Failure | type=mechanic | hint=Critical failure rules]] occurs, depending on the relationship between an item and its owner, determine whether the item activates an ability for its owner.  
   - [[UNCLEAR: The trigger/decision procedure for whether an item activates is not fully specified beyond “relationship with its owner”.]]

5. **Awakened intellect:** Non-intelligent creatures, undead, and animals in the area gain intelligence. They can no longer be enslaved unless they do so voluntarily or are [[LINK LATER: Suppressed | type=condition | hint=Control/enslavement rules]].  
   - [[UNCLEAR: “Suppressed” is not defined here (method/threshold unclear).]]

### Wisdom Use

- **Cost:** 5 **Spirituality** per use. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=Resource/points]]
- **Use:** When you cast an **Extraordinary Ability**, you may choose one skill you have already mastered and incorporate it into that Ability’s effect. [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Abilities | type=rule | hint=Core rules]]

If you want to use any of the effects below, the corresponding skill must reach **Master**, or be replaced by [[LINK LATER: Pathway Knowledge | type=term | hint=Master-rank substitute]] (Master).

#### Power-related

- **Climbing:** If your Ability is blocked by a wall, you may select targets through the wall. The surrounding wall must be hollow and not sealed.
- **Swim:** Whatever form your Abilities take (even fire), they can exist underwater.
- **Throwing:** You may use the Ability in place of a Throwing check; if so, melee can hit targets up to five times your Strength away.  
  - [[UNCLEAR: Distance scaling “five times your Strength away” lacks units/definition here.]]
- **Fighting:** You may use the Ability in place of Fighting checks; ranged skills can be used for melee. This does not increase Strength damage rolls.
- **Fighting (Great Weapon):** Any Ability you use in place of this check becomes melee, increasing damage equal to that of the Giant Weapon.  
  - [[UNCLEAR: “Great Weapon” vs “Giant Weapon” terminology may be inconsistent.]]
- **Fighting (Hand-to-Hand Combat):** Any Ability you use in place of this skill becomes melee and increases damage equal to a short blade. If it is an attack/casting-action Ability, it allows two combos; the second damage is halved; “take up all.”  
  - [[UNCLEAR: “take up all” is incomplete (all actions? all movement? other).]]
- **Intimidate:** After using any spellcasting/attack-action Ability, choose a target. The target makes a Difficulty Value 15 **Will** check; on failure, it falls into [[LINK LATER: Fear | type=condition | hint=Condition rules]]. The movement action is not affected.
- **Jump:** Any Ability can choose a target with twice the moving force upwards.  
  - [[UNCLEAR: “moving force” is not defined here (likely movement stat).]]
- **Survival:** Any Ability succeeds by default when it comes to escape or survival.
- **Beast Taming:** After successfully using a spellcasting/attack-action Ability, the target makes a Difficulty Value 15 **Will** check; on failure, the choice of a free/attack/casting/move action is up to you.  
  - [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether you choose one action type, the target’s next action, or all listed actions.]]

#### Education-related

- **Law:** After you successfully use a spellcasting/attack-action Ability, the opponent cannot use that same Ability within 1 round. If it is still used, make a Law appraisal against its [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=Defense rules]] to determine whether it is invalid.
- **Archeology:** Any Ability you successfully use does not damage the target’s objects of cultural or material value.
- **Religion:** Any Ability that involves a creature with divine nature suffers no [[LINK LATER: Disadvantage | type=mechanic | hint=Core rules]].
- **Navigate:** Any Ability can pinpoint the location of an invisible or hidden object. The object must be exposed and within the range of your Ability’s influence. This effect cannot allow your Ability to pass through walls.  
  - [[UNCLEAR: The requirement that an invisible/hidden object be “exposed” is potentially contradictory.]]
- **Medicine:** Any Ability gains a 3d6 [[LINK LATER: Hit Point Regeneration | type=mechanic | hint=Healing rules]] effect.
- **Crafting:** When an Ability is used on an item, you understand its composition.
- **History:** Any Ability reveals the affected thing’s position in your known history and whether it is connected.  
  - [[UNCLEAR: The meaning of “position in your known history” and “whether it is connected” is not defined here.]]
- **Use of the Library:** Any Ability can determine whether the target has knowledge carriers (words, pictures, etc.). If the target has no [[LINK LATER: Anti-Divination | type=mechanic | hint=Protection rules]] feature, its content is revealed.
