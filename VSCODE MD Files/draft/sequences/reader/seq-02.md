## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Intuition (INT)** +3, **Education** +2.
- Increase all **Intuition (INT)**-related skills by 1 level.

### The Temples Come Down

- **Cost:** 10 **Spirituality** each round. [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**. Casting Action
- **Targeting and range:** Covers an area up to 10 kilometers.
- **Effect:** Your **Temple of Knowledge** immediately materializes within the area. [[Temple of Knowledge]]  
  Every book within becomes physical (can be touched and read). While you are within the area, you gain all of the following benefits:

1. **Automatic absorption of written/visual knowledge:** Knowledge carriers presented as words, pictures, etc. are automatically read by the Temple at a speed of up to **100 pages per round**. Identical-content books consolidate into bookshelves, and their information is printed immediately into your mind.  
   - **Limit:** Repeated knowledge usually does not improve skills (see [[Quick Reading]]).

2. **Default success on non-opposed appraisals:** All skill appraisals that do not involve confrontation, and all **Education** and **Intuition (INT)** attribute appraisals, succeed by default. When confrontation is involved, you gain [[Advantage]].

3. **Identification modifiers:** Choose any number of friendly units (not including yourself). They gain +2 to **Intuition (INT)**-related identification. All skill identifications made by your enemy units suffer -2.

4. **Wisdom for inactive Extraordinary Items:** Choose 1 or more inactive [[Extraordinary Items]] to gain wisdom. Whenever a Big Failure occurs, if the item is in its ownerâ€™s possession and has been used by them before, it activates an ability for its owner; otherwise it does not.

5. **Awakened intellect:** Non-intelligent creatures, undead, and animals in the area gain intelligence. They can no longer be enslaved unless they do so voluntarily or are **Suppressed** (under a suppression effect that negates extraordinary abilities).

### Wisdom Use

- **Climbing:** If your Ability is blocked by a wall, you may select targets through the wall. The surrounding wall must be hollow and not sealed.
- **Swim:** Whatever form your Abilities take (even fire), they can exist underwater.
- **Throwing:** You may use the Ability in place of a Throwing check; if so, melee can hit targets up to **five times your Strength in meters** away.
- **Fighting:** You may use the Ability in place of Fighting checks; ranged skills can be used for melee. This does not increase Strength damage rolls.
- **Fighting (Giant Weapon):** Any Ability you use in place of this check becomes melee, increasing damage equal to that of the Giant Weapon.  
- **Fighting (Hand-to-Hand Combat):** Any Ability you use in place of this skill becomes melee and increases damage equal to a short blade. If it is an attack/casting-action Ability, it allows two combos; the second damage is halved; this uses **all** your actions for the round.  
- **Intimidate:** After using any spellcasting/attack-action Ability, choose a target. The target makes a Difficulty Value 15 **Will** check; on failure, it falls into [[Fear]]. The movement action is not affected.

- **Archeology:** Any Ability you successfully use does not damage the targetâ€™s objects of cultural or material value.
- **Religion:** Any Ability that involves a creature with divine nature suffers no Disadvantage.
- **Navigate:** Any Ability can pinpoint an invisible/hidden object if its approximate location is exposed/known and within the Ability's range. This effect does not allow the Ability to pass through walls.  
- **Medicine:** Any Ability gains a 3d6 [[Hit Point Regeneration]] effect.
- **Crafting:** When an Ability is used on an item, you understand its composition.
- **History:** Any Ability reveals the affected thingâ€™s position in your known history (era/lineage) and whether it is connected to known events.  
- **Use of the Library:** Any Ability can determine whether the target has knowledge carriers (words, pictures, etc.). If the target has no [[id:alias-anti-divination|Anti-Divination]] feature, its content is revealed.
