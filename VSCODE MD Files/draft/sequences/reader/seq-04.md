# Sequence 4: Prophet

## Prophet

> **Lore:** Begin mastering higher-level mystic knowledge in the field of destiny, awakening **Prophecy** [[LINK LATER: Prophecy | type=mechanic | hint=Prophet ability]].

> **Lore:** Create a rational anchor within the irrational torrent of fate.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Relying on your own strength, reveal a secret event, calculate its future development, and confirm the development is indeed true. The higher the level of secrecy involved, the better the effect.
  > **GM Note:** This ritual is marked “unofficial ceremony” in the source text.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +2; Education +2; your knowledge of fate and mysticism rises by one level ([[LINK LATER: Fate Knowledge | type=term | hint=knowledge domain]]).

### Proficient in Knowledge

- **Use:** Passive.
- **Effect:**
  - Your **Spiritual Vision** [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Vision | type=term | hint=sense ability]] can mark objects that contain knowledge carriers (words, pictures, etc.) within your field of vision.
  - Your **Spiritual Intuition** [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition | type=term | hint=sense ability]] can perceive similar knowledge carriers within 1 kilometer (directional sense).
  - You do not need to touch knowledge carriers to read them, as long as they are within your field of vision.
  - You can see text and pictures hidden in clothing or body parts, as long as the relevant objects do not have **Anti-Divination** [[LINK LATER: Anti-Divination | type=mechanic]] and **Anti-Prophecy** [[LINK LATER: Anti-Prophecy | type=mechanic]] characteristics.
- **Limits:**
  - Sequence 3 improvement: the intuition perception range increases to 5 kilometers ([[LINK LATER: Sequence 3 | type=sequence | hint=same Pathway]]).
  - This is a potion effect ([[LINK LATER: Potion Effects | type=rule | hint=stealing/recording potion effects]]) and cannot be stolen or recorded.

### Quick Reading

- **Use:** Passive.
- **Effect:**
  - During the middle and low Sequence period, it takes you 1 minute to complete “library identification with familiarity of knowledge”—specifically, locating the relevant materials (excluding travel time to retrieve books).
  - You now need 5 minutes to read a book that would normally take a month to read (instead of a book that would normally take a week to read).
- **Limits:**
  - Sequence 3 improvement: reading a book that would normally take a month takes 1 minute ([[LINK LATER: Sequence 3 | type=sequence | hint=same Pathway]]).

### Prophecy

- **Cost:** 8 points of **Spirituality** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource pool]].
- **Use:** 1 **Spell-Casting Action** [[LINK LATER: Spell-Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]].
- **Effect:**
  - Conduct a **Fate Knowledge Appraisal** [[LINK LATER: Fate Knowledge Appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=used by Prophecy]] and judge the prophecy result based on that appraisal.
  - The prophecy is subject to the following Difficulty results:
    - **Difficulty 20:** Predict exactly what will happen in the next hour, excluding the effects of making changes accordingly.
    - **Difficulty 25:** Predict exactly what will happen in the next 6 hours, excluding the effects of making changes accordingly.
    - **Difficulty 30:** Predict exactly what will happen in the next 12 hours, excluding the effects of making changes accordingly.
    - **Difficulty 35:** Accurately predict what will happen in the next 24 hours, excluding the impact of making changes based on it. After 12 hours, the information begins to blur or contain certain errors.
    - **Difficulty 40 (Long-Term Prediction):** Predict things that will happen in at least one month, up to ten years or decades. The content will be very general, and unless there are enough [[LINK LATER: Clues | type=term | hint=information required for Prophecy]] the predicted matters must be strongly related to you.
    - **Difficulty 30 (Other Uses):** Prophecy can be used in reverse, and can be used with previous abilities to “go back to the previous things.”
- **Limits:**
  - Before obtaining new clues, repeating the same prophecy does not change the result.
  - Foretelling others requires obtaining clues first.
  - Prophecy is not affected by **Anti-Divination** [[LINK LATER: Anti-Divination | type=mechanic]]. It is essentially logical deduction based on [[LINK LATER: Fate Knowledge | type=term | hint=knowledge domain]], so even if anti-divination occurs, key information can still be obtained.
  - Because it relies on deduction, prophecy can lead in the wrong direction if the deduction is based on wrong information.
  - Prophecies lacking clues may be inconsistent with reality. If key information lacks information, it will not be presented and will be replaced by other reasonable content.
- **Aftereffects:**
  - **Great Success** [[LINK LATER: Great Success | type=rule | hint=appraisal outcome tier]]: Your prediction involves a key piece of information. If you did not have a clue for that key piece of information when you made the prediction, it changes to a key piece of information involving a clue you do have.
  - **Big Failure** [[LINK LATER: Big Failure | type=rule | hint=appraisal outcome tier]]: Your prophecy leads in a half-true or terribly wrong direction, and you must believe it until you get new clues.

[[UNCLEAR: “Used in reverse” and “go back to the previous things” are not precisely defined in the source text.]]

> **GM Note:** Long-term prophecy example: you can predict you will encounter a desperate situation, and that “someone you know somewhere” will help you, but you do not know what the situation is or who will help you. If the indicated place involves someone you do not already know, you may need to go there and befriend people to establish the connection—if you do not, the rescuer may not appear when you encounter difficulties.
>
> **GM Note:** Another example: you can predict the approximate time a major disaster will come because it is strongly related to yourself.
