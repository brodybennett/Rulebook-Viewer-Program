# Reader Pathway: Sequence 9

## Reader

> **Lore:** Represents omniscience and omnipotence. The mythical creature takes the form of a tall tower of books with brass-colored eyes, corresponding to the [[Tarot — Tower]].

You gain the following extraordinary abilities.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Intuition (INT)** +2.
- **Effect:**
  - Your [[Library Use]] can be improved quickly.
  - For every two skills you have reached **Master** (including previous skills), increase your **Library Use** by +1 level (maximum **Master**). Skill Ranks
  - When creating a character that has not just been promoted, you can use three times the **Intuition (INT)** brought by the potion to add Growth skills. See [[Skill Association/Growth]].

### Thinking Palace (Memory Palace)

- **Cost:** 1 Free Action.
- **Use:** Enter your Thinking Palace mentally at any time.
- **Effect:**
  - You enter an imaginary space that exists only in your mind; external time continues as usual.
  - If you only want to recall knowledge, you can recall information you already know in 1 second.
  - Everything you have read or seen appears in this space as books; you can read them again at any time.
- **Aftereffects:** You will never forget information stored this way.
- **Limits:** This ability cannot be recorded or stolen.

> **Lore:** First decide the form of this world—such as the traditional Hongdae Library, the illusory White Tower of infinite height, and more. No matter which form you choose, it is the starting point of your step-by-step path to omniscience.

> **GM Note:** Under special circumstances, ordinary people can also master this memory method.

### Ritual Mastery
- **Effect:** While holding this ability, you gain access to ritual magic, regardless of whether your Occult skill is advanced or not.


  - You gain access to [[Ritual Magic]], able to invoke power from the gods.
  - While you have this ability, you can use ritual magic regardless of whether your occult skill is advanced.
- **Reference:** For ritual magic you can use, see [[Common Ritual Magic]].
- **Sequence Upgrades:** At **Sequence 8**, your [[Occult Identification]] is successful by default when performing ritual magic.
- **Limits:** This effect is brought by a potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.

### Proficiency in Languages

- **Effect:**
  - You are proficient in all language skills by default, even alien languages.
  - This does not mean you can speak alien languages casually; when you encounter alien creatures, you can still communicate smoothly through the influence of the [[Spirit World]], as long as the relevant information exists in the Spirit World.
- **Limits:** This does not include the “language of the old days.” [[Language of the Old Days]]

### Speed Reading

- **Effect:**
  - Your Library Identification can be completed in 30 minutes, no matter how rare the book you’re looking for is, as long as it exists. [[Library Identification]]
  - You can read in 1 hour what would take 1 week to read.
- **Reading Outcomes (by book type):**
  - **Books with simple knowledge:** After reading, the corresponding skills can be directly trained.
  - **Books with rich knowledge:** After reading, the corresponding skills can directly reach **Proficiency**. Skill Ranks
  - **Books with deepening knowledge:** You must be **Proficient** in the corresponding skills before you can read them. After reading, you rise by +1 level. Skill Ranks
- **Limits (Advanced and beyond):**
  - From reaching the **Advanced** level, if you want to continue learning corresponding knowledge, you must continue to obtain books with deepening knowledge.
  - The content direction of these books cannot be repeated.
- **Sequence Upgrades:**
  - **Sequence 8:** The time required to read books becomes 30 minutes; Library Identification becomes 15 minutes.
  - **Sequence 6:** The time required to read books becomes 15 minutes; Library Identification becomes 5 minutes.

> **GM Note:** The same broad field can split into many non-overlapping directions at higher levels (e.g., “Medicine” versus “Medicine (Anesthesia)”). If needed, refer to [[Chapter 4 — Trained Skills]] to learn knowledge.

- **Special (clarified):** When creating a Reader at Sequence 9 or higher (and the character has not just been promoted), the Extraordinary can use twice the **Intuition (INT)** points brought by the potion to train or become proficient in skills (limit: **Proficiency**) to solve the problem that a higher-sequence Reader has not accumulated knowledge.
  - This doubled Intuition (INT) should not be used to increase [[Reputation]], but can be used to increase extraordinary knowledge.

### Knowledgeable

- **Cost:** 1 Free Action.
- **Use:** Open your vision.
- **Effect:**
  - You see carriers of knowledge (words, pictures, etc.) as if written in a certain way; they exude a brass or silver symbolic aura.
  - You can use this to find these carriers, and even read the contents directly through the cover.
- **Limits:** The object must be within your line of sight and not blocked by other people’s clothing or limbs.
- **Limits:** This ability cannot be recorded or stolen.

- **Training Limits:**
  - The skills above cannot be trained by normal means.
  - Only when the Reader is above Sequence 9 may it be allowed to use the attributes brought by the potion to add skill points.

- **Gaining Skill Levels (usually via the following actions):**
  1. Read 3, 6, and 9 potion formulas of this Pathway: +1 skill level. [[Potion Formulas]]
  2. Those who have seen the way to fight: +1 skill level.
  3. The battle of those who know the way: +1 skill level.
  4. Experience extraordinary events dominated by the existence of this Pathway: +1 skill level.
  5. Know the characteristics of Extraordinary at at least 4 Sequence levels: +1 skill level.
  6. Analyze the blood of the channeler: +1 skill level.
  7. Directly analyze an Extraordinary person / Extraordinary characteristics / Extraordinary items: +1 skill level (each item). This repeats with ②, ③, and ⑥ respectively and cannot be superimposed.
     - The method of analysis can be observing the opponent’s performance, habits, and ability characteristics.
     - This requires the mind to summarize or write a report: speculate on principles/logic and behaviors, explain supernatural phenomena in scientific terms from a mysticism perspective, and explain the effects of acting and why it is effective.

- **Maximum Gains:** Each type of extraordinary knowledge can gain a total of six skill levels from any of the channels above (maximum +6 bonus).

- **Substitution Rule:**
  - You can use **Education + Extraordinary Knowledge** to replace other attributes + skills.
  - Hidden knowledge in brackets can only be replaced after analyzing the corresponding special Sequence ability.
  - You can apply to the GM for replacement of related skills that are listed with omissions.

- **Allowed Substitutions (by knowledge type):**
  - Divination Knowledge: Alternative Occult [Divination Related], (Disguise, Archeology, History).
  - Apprentice Knowledge: Substitute Locksmith, (Pilot).
  - Stealing Knowledge: Alternate Hand, (Cheat).
  - Writing Knowledge: Alternative Arts: Writing, Psychology, (Psychoanalysis).
  - Sailor Knowledge: Alternative Swimming, Art: Singing.
  - Sun Knowledge: Corresponding Art: Singing, (Religion).
  - Flesh Knowledge: Substitute Listening, Intimidation.
  - Reading Knowledge: Alternative Libraries, (Scout, Track).
  - Knowledge of Death: Alternative Survival, (Pilot).
  - Lore of the Night: Replaces Stealth.
  - Combat Knowledge: Instead of full Fighting, full Shooting, and Throwing; it is considered an extra +1 level only when making Identification checks with those skills.

  - Trial Knowledge: Alternative Law (Credit).
  - Hunting Knowledge: Alternative Survival, Tracking, Crafting (traps only).

  - Earth Knowledge: Alternative Sciences: Biology, (Medicine).
  - Knowledge of Destiny: Alternative Scouting.
  - Prying Knowledge: Alternative Occultism, (Combat).
  - Artisan Knowledge: Alternative Craft Manufacturing, Mechanical Repair, (Archaeology, History).

- **Special (Reading Knowledge):**
  - If there is a “reading knowledge” situation, the extraordinary person’s Sequence level can be converted into the bonus value of reading knowledge. Use this formula: reading-knowledge bonus = (10 - Sequence number). Example: Sequence 9 = +1, Sequence 8 = +2, ... Sequence 0 = +10.
  - “Reading knowledge” should not be used except in special cases, because this is yourself—an understanding of the way.
  - A Reader simulates other Pathway abilities or occult skills that another Reader simulates should correspond to knowledge other than reading knowledge.

### Spiritual Vision
- **Use:** 1 **free action** to activate.
- **Cost:** 1 **spirituality point per round** while active.
- **Effect:** While active, your vision gains the following benefits:


  1. **Etheric Body:** You can directly see the target’s health status through aura color, and directly find where the other party’s body is uncomfortable or has a problem. When it comes to a certain organ, you can see the inside through the unthickened door and confirm the number of people inside.
  2. **Spiritual Body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality. This cannot identify Extraordinary people. You can also penetrate the door to see the inside, identify whether there is ritual magic power, and penetrate the [[Spiritual Wall]].
  3. **Mental Body:** You can see the color represented by the other person’s emotions, but only as general content (e.g., depressed or uneasy). Negative emotions are usually dark tones.
  4. **Astral Body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5. While in Spiritual Vision, your [[Spiritual Intuition]] test gains +2.

- **Additional Notes:**
  - Dead creatures are usually dull in color and cannot be recognized.
  - Spiritual materials usually have spirituality.
  - The color of material in Spiritual Vision usually represents its corresponding Pathway; this does not mean you can see the power of a Beyonder Pathway.
  - Spiritual Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default if they have not dissipated for 24 hours.
  - This ability cannot be recorded or stolen.
