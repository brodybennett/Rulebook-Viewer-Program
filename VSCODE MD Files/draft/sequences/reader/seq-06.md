# Sequence 6: Polymath

## Polymath

**Polymath** is the ability to recognize, observe, remember, and imitate what you have witnessed.

- Unlike the [[LINK LATER: Recorder | type=sequence | hint=Reader Pathway]], the [[LINK LATER: Educational Scholar | type=sequence | hint=Reader Pathway]] imitates by learning and analyzing the principles behind extraordinary abilities.
- There is no limit to how many times you can use this, but your imitation cannot reach the original ability’s full power.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +2.
- Your [[LINK LATER: Potion Skills | type=mechanic | hint=Sequence 7]] can be quickly upgraded to [[LINK LATER: Erudition | type=term | hint=skill rank]].
- If you have reached the upper limit of Erudition, you can be upgraded to [[LINK LATER: Master | type=term | hint=skill rank]].

### Analysis

- **Cost:** 2 **Spirituality Points** ([[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=term]]).
- **Use:** **Free Action** ([[LINK LATER: Actions | type=rule | hint=Free Action]]). Whenever you recognize the use of an extraordinary ability, you may immediately conduct a corresponding [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Knowledge Identification | type=mechanic | hint=Analysis]].
- **Check:** Initial Difficulty 20.
  - For each Sequence level this ability is higher than yours: Difficulty +5.
  - For each character higher than you in this ability: Difficulty +5.
- **Requirements:** Some passives or abilities are difficult to recognize or observe, and may require the Beyonder to explain it to you.
- **Aftereffects:** When you lose **Sanity** ([[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term]]) while analyzing an ability: for every 1 Sanity lost, “analysis -1 disadvantage”. If the Sanity exceeds the upper limit, a bonus will be obtained.
  - Sanity loss from Analysis does not affect other abilities.
  > **Lore:** “Practice” is closer to experience than “theory.”
- **Effect (On Success):**
  - You reveal the specific effects of the extraordinary ability, including strengths and weaknesses.
  - People who are higher than 2 can only know part of the effects and cannot simulate them, but they still enjoy the second benefit.
  - From the next time onwards, when you are hit by this extraordinary ability, you gain 4 points of **Deflection Defense** ([[LINK LATER: Deflection Defense | type=mechanic]]), **or** a +4 advantage in [[LINK LATER: Countermeasures | type=mechanic]], [[LINK LATER: Awakening | type=mechanic]], etc. checks.
  - This ability is included in the range of abilities that can be simulated by you, and you can write this ability into your [[LINK LATER: Character Card | type=term]].
- **Special:** When creating a higher-sequence reader character card, it can be regarded as having as many extraordinary knowledge bonuses as there are corresponding resolved abilities.
  - Example: a certain path knowledge of +8 means that most abilities can be selected.
  - Generally, such benefits obtained when creating a character cannot exceed your own Sequence limit.

[[UNCLEAR: “analysis -1 disadvantage” and the “Sanity exceeds the upper limit” bonus condition are not defined clearly.]]
[[UNCLEAR: “People who are higher than 2” and “for each character higher than you in this ability” do not specify the comparison measure.]]

### Simulation

- **Cost:** 1 corresponding action consumes the corresponding spirituality.
- **Use:** Choose 1 ability that you have analyzed to simulate.
- **Check (First Simulation per ability):**
  - The first simulation of a given ability requires a corresponding [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Knowledge Appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation]] with Difficulty 30.
  - Every time the Analysis appraisal is 5 higher than the required difficulty, reduce the required Simulation difficulty by 5.
  - If the simulated ability is higher than the Sequence or character, the Difficulty increases as with Analysis.
- **Effect:**
  - When using the simulated ability, no matter what the original ability is identified with, you can only change to the corresponding Knowledge identification.
  - After the first simulation is successful, this ability can be used permanently. If it fails, the simulation can be repeated until it succeeds.
  - There will inevitably be a gap between the simulated ability and the original version; the size of the gap depends on your [[LINK LATER: Path Knowledge | type=term]] level.
- **Limits (Gaps from the original ability):**
  1. Swift/free-action abilities can only be cast with the action of casting or attacking. Casting/attacking/moving/full-round actions remain unchanged.
  2. Area abilities become single-target abilities. Single-target abilities change to require physical contact to take effect.
     - If you use the ability on yourself, you must remain in contact with yourself the entire time.
  3. Duration downgrades:
     - “Forever” → 24 hours
     - “Hours” → 5 minutes
     - “5 minutes” → 1 minute
     - “1 minute” → 3 rounds
     - “Rounds” → 1 round
     - “1 turn” → only takes effect for a moment
     - (Only affects abilities that explicitly mark duration; e.g., “paper double” is usually used instantly and is not affected.)
  4. Each time you use the simulated ability, you need a Difficulty 20 Knowledge appraisal.
     - Like Analysis, the Difficulty increases (as applicable).
     - If you fail, the action is not returned.
  5. Halving + doubling rules:
     - The effect is halved; damage is halved; number of uses is halved.
     - If you fall into a dream, you will wake up.
     - Identification requirements for inspiration are halved.
     - Negative effects remain the same and are rounded up; they will not be reduced to nothing.
     - Double the cost or Difficulty.
     - (Halving interaction: a substitute can offset only half once; it can be completely offset by consuming it twice in a row.)
- **Special (Passive abilities):** If the simulation is a passive ability, it requires 1 casting action to cast. To keep the passive ability lasting like the original version, you must pay 1 casting action continuously.
- **Path Knowledge thresholds (which gaps apply):**
  - Proficiency in Pathway knowledge and below: suffer all of 1–5.
  - Path knowledge advancement: suffer 2–5.
  - Path Knowledge Mastery: suffer 3–5, but do not suffer 4 for abilities not higher than Sequence or person.
  - Path knowledge and erudition: suffer 4–5, but abilities not higher than personal ability do not suffer 4.
  - Path to Master of Knowledge: suffer only 5.
  - If the simulated ability is lower than your own Sequence level or personality: no disadvantages, but Path Knowledge must be at least Erudition and above.

- **Special Simulation Situations:**
  1. [[LINK LATER: Secret Puppet | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: After successful [[LINK LATER: Marionette | type=mechanic | hint=Secret Puppet]], you need to continue to lose spellcasting actions to manipulate it.
     - If you suffer from gap (4), the secret puppet will be very stuck during operation (like a weird puppet show / frame drop), and each action of the secret puppet during battle needs to be identified by gap (4).
  2. [[LINK LATER: Herding | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: After successful grazing, you must continue to lose spellcasting actions to maintain it. Otherwise, due to extraordinary characteristics entering the body, immediately undergo a [[LINK LATER: Promotion Appraisal | type=mechanic]], and may become a Beyonder of the [[LINK LATER: Jumping Pathway | type=pathway]].
  3. [[LINK LATER: Recording | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: After successfully recording, you must continue to lose spellcasting actions to maintain the record; otherwise, the recording ability will disappear.
  4. [[LINK LATER: Faceless Man | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: Since the corresponding ability is a permanent physical change, there is no need to maintain it with ongoing action loss after completing the disguise.
  5. [[LINK LATER: Stealing Ability | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: Under gap (5), the stealing ability is only half effective (rounded up), and the stolen person only has half the ability left (rounded down).
  6. [[LINK LATER: Wronged Soul Transformation | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: Under gap (5), high-level invisible ones still exist, but if there are Beyonders in the same area who pass any Difficulty 20 inspiration, even if the purpose is not to find you, they can notice you through spirituality or using [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Vision | type=mechanic]] at that moment.
  7. [[LINK LATER: Arouse Undead Creatures | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: Undead creatures can continue to exist after being awakened, but to obey you when they are in front of you, you need to continue to lose the breath of magic to simulate death to suppress them.
     - They do not need to obey your orders when not in front of you.
     - Under gap (5), the value of the undead creature is halved (rounded up); it looks dull like a corpse; this does not affect use.
  8. [[LINK LATER: Craftsman-made Extraordinary Items | type=item | hint=Simulation special case]]: If the identification fails during the first simulation and while suffering from gap (4), the characteristics are also considered incorporated.
     - The effects of produced extraordinary items are random; benefits are only 1d2; disadvantages remain the same.
  9. [[LINK LATER: Accumulate Luck | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: Accumulated luck also needs continuous loss and casting to maintain.
  10. [[LINK LATER: Malicious Perception | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: As a passive ability, it also needs continuous loss to maintain.
  11. [[LINK LATER: Flesh Magic | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: As long as the flesh and blood stacked into the body is adjusted properly, it is regarded as part of the body and does not need to be maintained.
  12. [[LINK LATER: Traveler's Gate | type=mechanic | hint=Simulation special case]]: Quick flash can only guarantee complete physical defense; you will still lose agility and dodge in physical defense in the face of light, lightning, and area attacks.

> **GM Note:** More special simulations are decided by the **GM**. As long as an ability does not gain benefits permanently like grazing, secret puppet, and recording, or the benefit has nothing to do with extraordinary results (such as faceless man), then there is no need to continue to maintain it.
> **GM Note:** A common point of the above abilities is that most of them have certain permanent passive effects.

[[UNCLEAR: “higher than the Sequence or character,” “Sequence level or personality,” and “lose spellcasting actions” are not defined precisely enough to resolve comparisons or action-economy details.]]
