# Sequence 3: Pallbearers

[[UNCLEAR: The RAW does not specify the Pathway name for this Sequence.]]

## Pallbearers

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

**Ceremony:** Open up an area in the depths of the forest. Use natural materials to carefully manufacture a cemetery and coffins that have not yet been buried; the more detailed and exquisite, the better.

Bring the dead who represent various classes and have not been rested as usual to this place, including:
- nobles
- merchants
- soldiers
- civilians
- vagabonds
- dead **Beyonder** [[LINK LATER: Beyonder | type=term | hint=character type]]s
- the remains of demigods [[LINK LATER: Demigod | type=term | hint=power tier/creature classification]]

After burying all coffins representing all classes and different groups of people, personally hold a prayer and requiem ceremony for them. Let the plants in the forest protect you together after exorcising evil spirits, and take the potion during baptism and prayers to the earth [[LINK LATER: Mother Earth | type=term | hint=deity/concept referenced by “bosom of Mother Earth”]].

> **GM Note:** RAW labels this as an “unofficial ceremony.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Strength** +1, **Constitution** +2, **Agility** +1.

### Earth

- **Use:** Once per round, as a **free action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]], choose an ordinary corpse.
- **Effect:** The corpse’s spirit and body are engulfed in the earth, resting body and spirit, returning it to the bosom of Mother Earth [[LINK LATER: Mother Earth | type=term | hint=deity/concept referenced by “bosom of Mother Earth”]].
- **Aftereffects:** Each time you do this, you regain 2d3 points of **spirituality** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource pool]] and 1 point of **Sanity** [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term | hint=mental resource]].

### Pallbearer

- **Effect:** You deal an additional 2d6 damage to undead [[LINK LATER: Undead | type=term | hint=creature type]].
- **Effect:** Damage to you from curses is halved when it is undead damage.

### Soul to Earth

- **Cost:** 5 points of **spirituality** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource pool]].
- **Use:** A **spellcasting action** [[LINK LATER: Spellcasting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]].
- **Targeting and range:** One or more undead [[LINK LATER: Undead | type=term | hint=creature type]] creatures within line of sight [[LINK LATER: Line of Sight | type=mechanic | hint=visibility targeting rule]].
- **Effect:** Biological defense against physical defense [[LINK LATER: Biological Defense | type=term | hint=defense/stat used in resolution]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=term | hint=defense/stat used in resolution]]. Targets are entangled in plants, and the body is quickly assimilated into plants, as if it has experienced a hundred years of wind and frost.
- **Effect:** An undead so swept up is considered **bound** [[LINK LATER: Bound | type=condition | hint=restrained/imprisoned state]] and loses 2d6 **hit points** [[LINK LATER: Hit Points | type=term | hint=health value]] at the end of each turn, or spirit if it is a spirit.

**Undead resolution by relative Sequence Level** [[LINK LATER: Sequence Level | type=mechanic | hint=relative level comparison]]:
- Undead creatures three or more **Sequence Levels** lower than you: are buried directly after its turn.
- Undead creatures two sequence levels lower than you: immediately entombed after a full round.
- Undead creatures one sequence level lower than you: requires two full rounds, and allows a **Strength appraisal** [[LINK LATER: Strength Appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=Strength-based check/test]] (Difficulty Value [[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=term | hint=check difficulty]] 25) against breaking free.
- Undead creatures of the same level as you: it takes a full five rounds, and it can also break free, but it will continue to be affected by the effects of restraint and spiritual loss of life.

**Special:**
- This ability requires a two-round initiation for incorporeal undead [[LINK LATER: Incorporeal | type=term | hint=creature trait]] of Sequence 5, and is normal for levels below this level.

**Living creatures or things:**
- This ability can also work on living creatures or things, but the living creature cannot be buried until its **hit points** [[LINK LATER: Hit Points | type=term | hint=health value]] reach 0, and it is continuously allowed to try to break free.
- When its hit points reach 0, it is immediately buried.

**Supplement (Vegetative State):**
- Whenever this ability imprisons a creature, the target will enter a **vegetative state** [[LINK LATER: Vegetative State | type=condition | hint=action restriction condition]] every time it suffers the loss of life and spirituality of Soul to Earth.
- In the vegetative state, only one free action can be performed per round, and it cannot be combined with other reduced actions.
- The effect stacks.
- The duration of the vegetative state after breaking free is equal to the time of being restrained.

**Re-shackle (after breaking free):**
- **Cost:** 4 points of **spirituality** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource pool]].
- **Use:** When a creature breaks free, you use your biology to fight against it.
- **Resolution:** The difficulty of the fight is the result of the **Strength appraisal** [[LINK LATER: Strength Appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=Strength-based check/test]] when the opponent broke free.
- **Limits:** Each target can only be reshackled in this way once per **encounter** [[LINK LATER: Encounter | type=mechanic | hint=scene/initiative timeframe]].

**Sequence 2 notes (as written in RAW):**
- Against non-demigod undead, it only takes the time your turn ends.
- Against demigod level, it takes two rounds but cannot break free through Strength confrontation.
- Against angel level [[LINK LATER: Angel | type=term | hint=power tier/creature classification]], it still takes a full five rounds, suffering the same bind and life drain effects while being able to break free.
- At the same time, this skill of you in Sequence 2 treats living creatures and dead creatures equally.
