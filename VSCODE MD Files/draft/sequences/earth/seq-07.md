  - When **Harvest** is used to increase plant production, the number of harvests can be increased by five times.

#### Available Plants

> **GM Note:** More common plants may be allowed by the GM. If the situation permits, the Harvest Priest may obtain or edit extraordinary crops usable in battle.

- Plant identification for the options below uses **Inspiration + Botany** skill identification.
1. **Vines**
   - **HP (blood volume):** 20
   - **Actions:** 1 attack action per round
   - **Effect:** Deal **1d6** physical damage to 1 target (targets **Physical Defense**), or take the special action **Grapple**.

   - **Actions:** 1 attack action or 1 casting action per round

#### Plant Behavior in Battle

The Harvest Priest’s plants are regarded as a whole in battle. Once produced, they grow wildly, break through the ground, and cover the surroundings with jungles.

- **Range:** They can attack any creature within **100 meters**.
- **Movement:** They cannot move.

1. **Defenses (by total plant count)**
   - **Physical Defense:** 15 (Agility 5)
   - **Will Defense:** 15
   - Attacks against **Will Defense** are invalid for the plants.
   - For every **5** plants, the base of the two **Defense Values** increases by **+5**, up to **30**.
   - [[UNCLEAR: The RAW repeats “physical defense” twice while also referencing “will defense” and “two defenses”; the second defense is treated as Will Defense for the scaling rule.]]
2. **Damage Allocation (by type priority)**
   - Add up the **HP** of all plants by type (e.g., 2 vines = 40; 3 poisonous mushrooms = 45).
   - Set a priority order for these types; when the plants suffer damage, subtract **HP** from the highest-priority type first.
   - If a type’s **HP** is reduced to 0, all plants of that type are considered damaged.
3. **Activating plant abilities**
   - Every time a plant is “reached,” the Harvest Priest can choose **three** plants and activate the corresponding ability **once**.
   - You may choose repeated types, but only if there are multiple individuals of that type (e.g., if there is only one piranha, it can only be selected once).
   - [[UNCLEAR: The trigger “every time a plant is reached” is not defined in RAW (timing/trigger condition unclear).]]

#### Plant Vulnerabilities and Area Effects

- Plants take **double** damage from fire/toxin damage (type-dependent variations may apply).
- AoE damage is successful by default.
- Due to their large size, plants cannot move quickly, so they cannot be avoided.

#### Seed and Plant Limits

- Each time you use **Harvest**, you can harvest up to **5** seeds.
- Land can provide up to **5** seeds per **100 meters** of land (you can choose the specific number).
- The seeds carried by the Harvest Priest should be limited (seeds are equivalent to small volume). See [[Carrying Items]].
- **Bottled powder:** Equivalent to small and medium-sized items.
  - Bottled seeds: the amount of powder in a bottle is equivalent to **5** seeds.
- At most **10** kinds of harvested plants can exist in an area of **100 meters** at the same time (space-size limitation).

#### Plants Harvested from the Land

When harvesting from land (as long as the land is not in a bad environment), roll the number of **1d3** you choose to determine the plants that appear. [[UNCLEAR: RAW does not define what “the number of 1d3 you choose” means (how many dice / what choice controls).]]

1. **Grasses/shrubs**
   - All effects are equivalent to **Vines**, but with obviously different manifestations.
2. **Mushroom**
   - Roll **1d2**:
     - 1 = common mushroom
     - 2 = poisonous mushroom
   - Common mushroom does not have poison ability.
3. **Sea of Flowers**
   - **HP (blood volume):** 15
   - Passive; will not participate in battle.
   - Its attack is successful by default.
   - It is an independent target, but its **HP** can be superimposed to occupy the upper limit of plants that exist at the same time.
   - **Special:**
     - While the Sea of Flowers exists, naturally produced pollen increases identification of all plants in the area by **+2**.
     - Characters with special backgrounds may suffer from hay fever after the battle.
     - Before leaving the Sea of Flowers, spells/attacks must be performed with **Difficulty Value 10**.

### Manipulate Plants

- **Cost:** 3 spiritual points
- **Use:** 1 spellcasting action
- **Targeting and range:** Choose a plant within 10 meters.
- **Effect:** Choose one effect to take effect.

1. **Manipulation attack**
   - You manipulate a plant, launching one of its executable actions.
2. **Entangle yourself**
   - You make a plant entangle yourself or others.
   - Gain **3** points of armor and temporary **+2 Constitution**.
   - This armor is destroyed after suffering any fire/toxin damage.
   - This armor cannot be superimposed with other external armor.
3. **Hiding in the forest**
   - You use plants to cover your whereabouts.
   - If others have not found you, your stealth identification is successful by default.
   - If you have been found, it is beneficial to change the stealth identification to **+4**.
   - This cannot be used to fight against effects such as [[Spiritual Body Line Vision]].
4. **Form Manipulation**
   - You coil plants into various shapes to do certain things on your behalf.
   - You do not share senses.

> **GM Note:** Other reasonable uses of manipulating plants may be allowed by the GM.
