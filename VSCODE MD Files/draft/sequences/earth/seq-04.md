# Sequence 4: Ancient Alchemist

> **Lore:** Known as a “classical alchemist” in ancient times, also called a “human alchemist.” They are said to calm low-intelligence extraordinary creatures, perform “life refinement” using incomplete spirits and materials, create various dolls (including golems), induce mutations, grow crops, increase the tendency to run out of control, and cure all injuries of [12].

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Refine a **Life Stone** by yourself. [[LINK LATER: Life Stone | type=item | hint=advancement ritual object]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +2, Dexterity +1, Inspiration +2, **Biology** +1 skill level. [[LINK LATER: Biology | type=term | hint=skill/attribute used for checks]]

### Alchemy of Life

You use incomplete spirits and materials to create a life.

- **Cost:** 4 **spirituality points**. [[LINK LATER: spirituality points | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent to cast abilities]]
- **Use:** As a **casting action**; takes 1d2 hours.
- **Effect:** Make a Biology check (**Difficulty Value** 20). On a success, you create one of the following alchemical creatures.

The creatures made from life tend to be a “template.” You can achieve the final life body you want through biological transformation.

- **Ordinary human being (long-lived):**
  - This human has no memory, or has a small part of the memory of the spirit body used.
  - You can communicate with them.
  - A human who lacks memory will usually obey you, but there are hidden dangers in mass production.
  - They can usually survive for 3 years; depending on your transformation, they can survive up to 10 years.
  - You can extend their life through other transformation methods.

- **Stone Golem:**
  - **Health Points:** 25
  - **Strength and attack identification:** +8
  - **Armor Defense:** 15+5
  - **Attack damage:** 2d6 physical damage
  - Helps you complete various transportation or combat operations.
  - **Immunity:** fire damage (Black Flame is not included). [[LINK LATER: Black Flame | type=term | hint=specific fire-type effect excluded from immunity]]

- **Earth Golem:**
  - **Health Points:** 20
  - **Strength and attack identification:** +5
  - **Armor Defense:** 10+5
  - **Attack damage:** 1d6 physical damage
  - Helps you complete various transportation or combat operations.
  - **Immunity:** lightning damage
  - **Damage taken:** fire damage received is halved
  - Perfectly integrates with the natural environment:
    - In a natural environment, +8 stealth identification
    - Considered invisible before being discovered. [[LINK LATER: invisibility | type=condition | hint=considered invisible before discovery]]

- **Steel Golem:**
  - **Health Points:** 35
  - **Strength and attack checks:** +10
  - **Armor Defense:** 15+8
  - **Attack damage:** 2d6+3 physical damage
  - **Damage taken:** fire damage it takes is halved
  - Helps you complete various transport or combat operations.
  - 10 consumable damage reduction. [[UNCLEAR: “10 consumable damage reduction” is not defined (what consumes it, and when it refreshes).]] [[LINK LATER: damage reduction | type=mechanic | hint=reduces incoming damage; 'consumable' qualifier unclear]]

- **Other original biological templates approved by GM.**

**Additional notes:**
- If you can find more suitable extraordinary materials and spiritual bodies, you can create a better existence on this basis.
- Note that, including Graeme, all creatures made by Life Refining have **spiritual threads**. [[UNCLEAR: “Graeme” is unclear in context (possibly a mistranslation or specific named example).]] [[LINK LATER: Life Refining | type=mechanic | hint=process referenced within Alchemy of Life]] [[LINK LATER: spiritual threads | type=term | hint=spiritual connection/constraint shared by created beings]]

**Limits and practical constraints:**
- Generally, there is no clear limit to the number of creatures you can create except that it takes time to refine.
- You need a place large enough to store them and provide corresponding daily consumption.
- As a standard, an ordinary ancient alchemist should not have more than ten of the above biological products.

### Crazy Induction

Increases the madness and out-of-control tendency of the person attacked.

- **Use:** Usually accompanied by an **attack action**; once per round.
- **Effect:** This takes effect on enemies who have suffered sanity checks in this round.
  - The enemy you attacked enters **temporary madness** if its **sanity damage** reaches 2 when it suffers a **sanity test** in this round. [[LINK LATER: sanity damage | type=mechanic | hint=madness-related damage track]] [[LINK LATER: sanity test | type=mechanic | hint=check associated with sanity damage]] [[LINK LATER: temporary madness | type=condition | hint=madness state triggered at threshold]]
  - The enemy you attacked enters **indeterminate madness** if its sanity damage reaches 5. [[LINK LATER: indeterminate madness | type=condition | hint=madness state triggered at higher threshold]]
  - If its sanity is less than 30%, it enters a state of **out of control**. [[UNCLEAR: RAW contains “its sanity is less than 100%. 30,” which appears to intend “less than 30%.”]] [[LINK LATER: out of control | type=condition | hint=loss-of-control state triggered by low sanity]]

- **Special:** A **Beyonder** of the **Spectator Pathway** can circumvent this effect by passing a successful **Mental Channeling** identification. [[LINK LATER: Spectator Pathway | type=pathway | hint=pathway with a mitigation for Crazy Induction]] [[LINK LATER: Mental Channeling | type=term | hint=identification/check used to bypass effect]]
