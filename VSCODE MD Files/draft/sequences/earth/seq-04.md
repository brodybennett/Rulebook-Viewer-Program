> **Lore:** Known as a “classical alchemist” in ancient times, also called a “human alchemist.” They are said to calm low-intelligence extraordinary creatures, perform “life refinement” using incomplete spirits and materials, create various dolls (including golems), induce mutations, grow crops, increase the tendency to run out of control, and cure all injuries of [12].

### Alchemy of Life

You use incomplete spirits and materials to create a life.

- **Cost:** 4 **spirituality points**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** As a **casting action**; takes 1d2 hours.
- **Effect:** Make a Biology check (**Difficulty Value** 20). On a success, you create one of the following alchemical creatures.

The creatures made from life tend to be a “template.” You can achieve the final life body you want through biological transformation.

- **Ordinary human being (long-lived):**
  - This human has no memory, or has a small part of the memory of the spirit body used.
  - You can communicate with them.
  - A human who lacks memory will usually obey you, but there are hidden dangers in mass production.
  - They can usually survive for 3 years; depending on your transformation, they can survive up to 10 years.
  - You can extend their life through other transformation methods.

  - **Health Points:** 25
  - **Strength and attack identification:** +8

  - **Health Points:** 35
  - **Strength and attack checks:** +10
  - **Armor Defense:** 15+8
  - **Attack damage:** 2d6+3 physical damage
  - **Damage taken:** fire damage it takes is halved
  - Helps you complete various transport or combat operations.
  - 10 consumable damage reduction. [[UNCLEAR: “10 consumable damage reduction” is not defined (what consumes it, and when it refreshes).]] [[damage reduction]]

- **Other original biological templates approved by GM.**

**Additional notes:**
- If you can find more suitable extraordinary materials and spiritual bodies, you can create a better existence on this basis.
- Note that, including Graeme, all creatures made by Life Refining have **spiritual threads**. [[UNCLEAR: “Graeme” is unclear in context (possibly a mistranslation or specific named example).]] [[Life Refining]] [[spiritual threads]]

**Limits and practical constraints:**
- Generally, there is no clear limit to the number of creatures you can create except that it takes time to refine.
- You need a place large enough to store them and provide corresponding daily consumption.
- As a standard, an ordinary ancient alchemist should not have more than ten of the above biological products.

### Crazy Induction

Increases the madness and out-of-control tendency of the person attacked.

- **Use:** Usually accompanied by an **attack action**; once per round.
- **Effect:** This takes effect on enemies who have suffered sanity checks in this round.
  - The enemy you attacked enters **temporary madness** if its **sanity damage** reaches 2 when it suffers a **sanity test** in this round. [[Sanity Damage]] [[sanity test]] [[Temporary Madness]]
  - The enemy you attacked enters **indeterminate madness** if its sanity damage reaches 5. [[indeterminate madness]]
  - If its sanity is less than 30%, it enters a state of **out of control**. [[UNCLEAR: RAW contains “its sanity is less than 100%. 30,” which appears to intend “less than 30%.”]] [[out of control]]

- **Special:** A **Beyonder** of the **Spectator Pathway** can circumvent this effect by passing a successful **Mental Channeling** identification. [[Spectator Pathway]] [[Mental Channeling]]
