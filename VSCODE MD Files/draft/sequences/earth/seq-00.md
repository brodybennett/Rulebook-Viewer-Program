# Mother Pathway: Sequence 0

## Mother

- See also: [[Mother Pathway]]
- True god of the Mother Pathway.

## Extraordinary Abilities

- It can shatter the earth and make the target fall into the [[Chaotic Sea]] in the center of the earth.
- It can make plants grow wildly and form a natural barrier that can isolate the attack of the true god. [[UNCLEAR: “isolate the attack of the true god” could mean blocking attacks made by the true god, or blocking attacks targeting the true god.]]
- It can turn the enemy into a plant and wither at the same time.
  > **Lore:** Returning to the embrace of the mother.
