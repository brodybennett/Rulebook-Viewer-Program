# Sequence 5: Druid

You can absorb nutrients and oxygen from the soil, and master earth-like spells.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Master the living habits and physical structure of a variety of ordinary animals and three extraordinary creatures.
  - As an integral part of the ritual, you must write down your accumulated knowledge and experience.

> **Lore:** Image of Extraordinary Characteristics: a group of brown “soil” with roots and hidden “vessels.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +2, Agility +1, Inspiration +1, Biology +1 level. [[UNCLEAR: “Biology +1 level” uses “level” without stating the game’s leveling scale for skills/attributes.]]
- Gain 10 poison resistance.
- Biology and Botany are allowed to quickly increase to master. [[UNCLEAR: “quickly increase to master” is not defined as a specific rate, cap, or rule procedure.]]

### **Drain the Earth**

You can extract nutrients and oxygen from the earth.

- **Passive (no action stated):**
  - You can maintain normal breathing in the ground.
  - Recover 1 HP every round.

- **Active:**
  - **Use:** 1 spell-casting action.
  - **Cost:** 3 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=term | hint=resource used for costs]]
  - **Targeting and range:** Affects the soil that you touch at least 10 meters away. [[UNCLEAR: The phrase combines “touch” with “at least 10 meters away,” making the actual range/requirement unclear.]]
  - **Effect:** Recover 1d6 HP.
    - If the land has mature plants, recover an additional 2d6 HP (deducted from the life of the plant). [[LINK LATER: Plant Life / Plant HP | type=mechanic | hint=how plants lose life from this effect]]

### **Subterranean Sneaking**

The ground under your feet suddenly softens and turns into a “swamp,” and you sink in.

- **Use:** 1 movement action.
- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=term | hint=resource used for costs]]
- **Effect:** You enter the ground and can move underground with normal movement power.

1. Each additional round you stay underground costs 1 additional spirituality point.
   - Your Stealth test underground is successful by default, provided the other party has not found you.
   - Otherwise, the other party can use Scouting against your Stealth +4 to find your position. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether “+4” applies to your Stealth, to the opponent’s Scouting, or to the opposed test structure.]]  
   [[LINK LATER: Stealth | type=term | hint=skill/test rules]]  
   [[LINK LATER: Scouting | type=term | hint=skill/test rules]]
2. You are immune to lightning damage in the ground.
   - If you use underground stealth when lightning comes, then if the lightning identification is successful, you suffer only half the damage (rounded up). [[UNCLEAR: “lightning identification” is not defined; it is unclear who makes it and what stat/skill governs it.]]
3. You cannot perform actions other than moving/free actions while underground, unless you use 1 free action to escape from stealth. [[UNCLEAR: “escape from stealth” is not defined as a procedure; it is unclear whether it ends the underground state, ends hiding, or both.]]

### **Create Vines**

You create vines out of thin air, causing them to pierce the ground and attack enemies.

#### Option 1: Vine Whip

- **Use:** 1 attack action.
- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=term | hint=resource used for costs]]
- **Effect:** Create a vine and treat it as a long whip.
  - **Dispelling:** 1 free action dispels it.
  - **Targeting and range:** 1 target within 5 meters.
  - **Check:** Strength + biological defense against physical defense. [[UNCLEAR: “biological defense” and the opposed structure are not defined; it is unclear whether this is an attack roll, a contest, or a specific subsystem.]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=term | hint=defense stat rules]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Biology (Defense) | type=term | hint=whether Biology provides a defense/attack modifier]]
  - **Damage:** 1d6 + half Strength damage dice (physical harm). [[UNCLEAR: “half Strength damage dice” does not specify whether it is added dice, a flat bonus, rounding rules, or how Strength converts to dice.]]

- **Special:**
  - The vine can hit 3 times in one attack action, split into three identifications:
    - Second hit: -4 disadvantage.
    - Third hit: -6 disadvantage.
  - If you suffer more than 10 points of fire damage, the vine will be damaged. [[UNCLEAR: “damaged” has no stated mechanical consequence (e.g., destroyed, reduced damage, ends effect).]]

#### Option 2: Ground-Piercing Vines

- **Use:** 1 spell-casting action.
- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=term | hint=resource used for costs]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within 50 meters.
- **Effect:** Press your hand to the ground; vines pierce up from the enemy’s feet and grow wildly.
  - **Check:** Inspiration + Biology against physical defense. [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute used in checks]] [[LINK LATER: Biology | type=term | hint=skill/attribute used in checks]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=term | hint=defense stat rules]]
  - **Damage:** 5d6 physical damage.

- **Special:**
  - The vine created by the spell-casting action is regarded as a seed of the harvest ability, which can attack the enemy by itself in the next step.  
    [[LINK LATER: Harvest Ability | type=mechanic | hint=rules for “seed of the harvest” and self-attacking behavior]]

### **Toxic Fog**

You cause puffs of yellow-green poisonous gas to spread; creatures who smell it start coughing.

- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=term | hint=resource used for costs]]
- **Targeting and range:** Affects all creatures/plants within 50 meters in front of you. [[UNCLEAR: “within 50 meters in front of you” does not specify shape (cone/line/area), width, or whether line-of-sight applies.]]
- **Check:** Inspiration + Biology against physical defense. [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute used in checks]] [[LINK LATER: Biology | type=term | hint=skill/attribute used in checks]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=term | hint=defense stat rules]]
- **Damage:** 2d6 poison damage.
- **Duration:** Fog persists in confined spaces; dissipates after 2 rounds in non-confined spaces.

1. If the fog persists, at the start of each next round you can make another check to cause damage without any action.
2. Creatures below your level (Sequence 9–7) that suffer 1 Toxic Fog damage suffer 1 poisonous effect, and roll 1d5 random poison to be generated; the toxins are random and not necessarily the same each time.  
   [[LINK LATER: Poisonous Effect | type=condition | hint=the “poisonous effect” gained from Toxic Fog]]  
   [[LINK LATER: Random Poison Table (d5) | type=table | hint=the list used when rolling 1d5 random poison]]
   - Special: Creatures at the same level as yours (Sequence 6–5) receive the effect after suffering 2 damages.
   - Higher than 1 character is invalid. [[UNCLEAR: This clause is not interpretable as a mechanical rule; “higher than 1 character” is undefined.]]

> **GM Note:** When the poisonous mist dissipates, the corresponding effect will be quickly relieved; the lost action is caused by an uncontrollable cough.

### **Incarnation of Animals**

You incarnate as an animal (e.g., a giant bear).

- **Use:** 1 swift action.
- **Cost:** 3 spirit points. [[UNCLEAR: This section uses “spirit points” while other abilities use “spirituality points”; it is unclear if these are the same resource.]]  
  [[LINK LATER: Spirit Points vs Spirituality Points | type=term | hint=resource naming/identity clarification]]
- **Duration:** 5 minutes.
- **Effect:** Choose one of the following forms:

1. **Dire Bear**
   - Life limit +10.
   - Regarded as a large-scale creature.
   - Strength +2, Constitution +2, Agility +1.
   - Gain 3 points of hair armor.
   - Additionally suffer 1d6 fire damage. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear when/why the 1d6 fire damage is suffered (on transformation, per round, when hit by fire, etc.).]]
2. **Cheetah**
   - Life limit +5.
   - Regarded as a medium-to-large creature.
   - Strength +1, Constitution +2, Agility +2.
   - Gain night vision ability; night vision cannot take effect in a completely dark environment. [[UNCLEAR: “night vision cannot take effect in a completely dark environment” conflicts with typical night vision logic and lacks a defined vision rule reference.]]
3. **Coyote**
   - Life limit +5.
   - Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1.
   - Gain Extraordinary Sense of Smell (refer to Moon Sequence 7). [[LINK LATER: Moon Pathway: Sequence 7 | type=sequence | hint=reference for Extraordinary Sense of Smell rules]]
   - Gain night vision ability; night vision cannot take effect in a completely dark environment. [[UNCLEAR: As above, the night vision limitation is not defined by a referenced vision system.]]
4. **Giant Eagle**
   - Life limit +5.
   - Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1.
   - You can use your mobility to fly. [[UNCLEAR: “use your mobility to fly” does not define flight speed, maneuverability, or constraints.]]
   - Gain night vision ability.
   - Your field of vision can be increased to 1 kilometer. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether this is maximum spotting distance, clarity, or a narrative statement; no perception system is referenced.]]
5. **Cats/Dogs**
   - Upper limit of HP -5 (the lost HP is recovered when the ability is canceled).
   - Regarded as a small and medium-sized creature.
   - Strength -1, Constitution -1, Dexterity +1.
   - Cats gain night vision.
   - Dogs gain Extraordinary Sense of Smell.
   - Special breeds do not reduce Strength and Constitution. [[UNCLEAR: “special breeds” is not defined as a list or selection rule.]]

#### Incarnation of Extraordinary Creatures (Partial)

Because extraordinary creatures are half-mad, you can only incarnate part of their limbs, and it takes 1/1d3 Sanity loss. [[UNCLEAR: “1/1d3 Sanity loss” does not specify whether you lose 1 Sanity, 1d3 Sanity, or choose between them.]]  
[[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term | hint=Sanity rules, loss triggers, and recovery]]

1. **Murloc**
   - Your skin grows phantom scales; your appearance becomes half murloc.
   - Gain 3 points of damage reduction.
   - Except for the precise control ability of the clown, you cannot be tackled. [[UNCLEAR: “cannot be tackled” is undefined; the “precise control ability of the clown” reference is not locally defined.]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Clown Precise Control | type=mechanic | hint=the “precise control ability of the clown” exception]]
   - Swimming and diving identification +4 is beneficial. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether “beneficial” means advantage, a flat bonus, or a specific system term.]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Swimming and Diving | type=term | hint=the identification/check used for swimming/diving]]

- Because the extraordinary creatures studied by Druids differ during promotion, only the most common murlocs are listed as an example.
- Druids can program 3 more extraordinary creatures by themselves (according to the promotion ceremony); each new extraordinary creature requires 1 week of research to obtain. [[LINK LATER: Promotion Ceremony | type=ritual | hint=the advancement ritual procedure that defines studied creatures]]
- Druids can also write logical, ordinary creatures that are allowed by the GM; the data needs to be written in advance. [[UNCLEAR: “allowed by the GM” and “data” are not defined as a formal creature-design process.]]
- The upper limit of extraordinary creatures for high-Sequence Druids can be changed to be equal to their Inspiration, but the ability still needs to be written in advance. [[UNCLEAR: “high-Sequence” threshold is not defined; the cap-change rule lacks timing/eligibility specifics.]]

### **Biocatalysis**

You catalyze the growth of certain organisms, including growth and metabolic processes in the body.

- **Use:** 1 casting action.
- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=term | hint=resource used for costs]]
- **Targeting and range:** All creatures within 1 or 50 meters area (not limited to plants). [[UNCLEAR: “within 1 or 50 meters area” does not specify which value applies, when, or how the area is shaped.]]
- **Effect:** Targets gain the catalysis of growth and “price,” speeding up function reaction rates. [[UNCLEAR: “price” is not interpretable as a mechanic; likely a mistranslation.]]

The catalytic ability can achieve the following effects:

1. **Catalyzed Hair**
   - The creature’s hair grows wildly and is regarded as an independent “plant” manipulated by you.
   - Every round, use your Inspiration + Biology to fight against the physical defenses of all affected creatures.
     - On success, they are grappled by their own hair.
     - Creatures without hair are instead affected via substitutes (e.g., nose hairs) that grow wildly.
   - Dealing 5 points of damage to the hair removes the effect. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether the 5 damage must be dealt in one hit, to the hair specifically, and what defenses the hair uses.]]
2. **Catalyzed Injury**
   - Affects targets who:
     - have suffered poison damage but have not received medical treatment, and
     - have HP less than half (rounded up) and have not received medical treatment.
   - You catalyze their injuries; they suffer 2d6 of the same type of damage.
3. **Catalyzed Recovery**
   - If the target suffers external damage but still has more than half of their health, **or** the injury has received medical treatment, you catalyze recovery.
   - The target recovers half of their constitution/constitution depending on whether they have received medical treatment or not. [[UNCLEAR: “constitution/constitution” is duplicated and does not state the recovery formula or rounding.]]
   - See “Spirituality and Other Status Recovery” for details.  
     [[LINK LATER: Spirituality and Other Status Recovery | type=rule | hint=recovery procedure referenced by Catalyzed Recovery]]
   - If you choose Catalyzed Recovery alone, the ability will not become a Catalyzed Injury. [[UNCLEAR: The rule implies an interaction/branching logic but does not define when/why recovery would “become” injury.]]
4. **Catalyzed Reaction**
   - You catalyze a creature’s chemical reaction rate when combined with a certain type of thing.
   - This ability is not calculated in detail; while you hold this ability, the time required for your biological experiment should be the minimum value.
   - Moon Pathway pharmaceuticals only take 3 minutes to finish. [[UNCLEAR: The referenced pharmaceutical rule is not defined here, and “minimum value” is not specified as a concrete number except the 3-minute example.]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Moon Pathway Pharmaceuticals | type=mechanic | hint=crafting/production time rules referenced as 3 minutes]]
5. **Catalyzing Extraordinary Characteristics**
   - For creatures that are producing Extraordinary Characteristics, the time to produce Extraordinary Characteristics is halved (rounded down).  
     [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Characteristics | type=term | hint=what they are, how they are produced, and timing rules]]
6. **Catalytic Metabolism**
   - Within 5 minutes, the creature either:
     - excretes toxins in its body (if it is not medically treated first, this becomes a Catalyzed Injury), or
     - digests what it has eaten.
   - This is invalid for things that cannot be metabolized. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear how to determine what “cannot be metabolized” within the system.]]
7. **Catalyzing Extraordinary Abilities**
   - Reduce the time required for a certain Extraordinary ability being cast:
     - swift action → free action
     - casting/attack action → swift action
     - full-round action → casting/attack action
   - Special: When faced with manipulation by the puppet master’s spiritual body string, this can only make the ability cast drop 1 level in the judgment. [[UNCLEAR: “drop 1 level in the judgment” lacks a defined action-time ladder or adjudication rule; “spiritual body string” is not defined here.]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Puppet Master Spiritual Body String | type=mechanic | hint=manipulation effect referenced here]]
8. **Catalytic Progress**
   - If an ability has manipulation level and poison level progress, after you use Biocatalysis on the affected target, the caster of that ability can immediately make another corresponding attack test to deepen the progress. [[UNCLEAR: “progress” and “manipulation/poison level” are not defined as tracked mechanics here.]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Progress Tracks (Manipulation/Poison) | type=mechanic | hint=how level/progress is tracked and deepened]]
9. **Catalytic Death**
   - Affects plants that died naturally and have not completely decayed; they regain vitality.

- Other logical uses of catalytic abilities allowed by the GM, which do not catalyze the speed of physical actions. [[UNCLEAR: The boundary of “logical uses” and what counts as “speed of physical actions” is not defined.]]
