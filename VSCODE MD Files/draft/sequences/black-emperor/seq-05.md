# Sequence 5: Chaos (Mentor)

- Improves majesty and physique, causing surrounding creatures to unconsciously lower their stature and desire to surrender.
- Can make a locked target (or an area around it) appear “chaotic,” making attacks harder to land on you and making enemies more likely to choose wrongly.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Establish your own authority in a place where there is not enough stable order, so the chaotic order can no longer harm you. Drink the [[LINK LATER: Magic Potion | type=item | hint=advancement potion]] at the moment when it can bring you benefits. *(Unofficial ceremony.)*

> **Lore:** The potion can distort and corrupt a [[LINK LATER: Beyonder | type=term | hint=supernatural practitioner]] through chaotic rules, potentially tearing the spirit body beyond what the self can bear. The intended approach is to establish an “order” with one’s own authority—similar to but different from the [[LINK LATER: Judge Pathway | type=pathway | hint=order/authority]]—and use that authority to “authorize” rules that balance chaos, so distorted order does not influence you and may even benefit you in turn.

> **GM Note:** This is described as a lawyer-like, hypocritical observance of rules; “establishing authority” is presented as the foundation of an emperor. Doing so where there is no stable order is meant to adapt to chaotic rules and rise above distortion. If a high-Sequence existence of the [[LINK LATER: Black Emperor Pathway | type=pathway | hint=territory/jurisdiction as distorted order]] is a friend, the Beyonder can do this within that being’s territory/jurisdiction, which makes the process more convenient because such territory/jurisdiction is itself a symbol of distorted order.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Constitution** +2
- **Inspiration** +1
- Your **Law** and **Deceit** skills increase by 1 level.
- Your Sequence 9 [[LINK LATER: Rapid Improvement | type=mechanic | hint=Sequence 9 rapid improvement skill limit]] skill limit reaches [[LINK LATER: Master | type=term | hint=skill proficiency tier]].

### Chaos

- **Cost:** 2 **spiritual points** ([[LINK LATER: Spiritual Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource pool]])
- **Use:** 1 **swift action** ([[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]), once per round; choose 1 effect below.
- **Effect:** Make a locked target ([[LINK LATER: Locked Target | type=mechanic | hint=target you have locked]])—or an area around it—appear “chaotic,” making attacks harder to land on you and making enemies more likely to choose wrongly.

Choose one of the following effects:

1. Choose any ongoing **skill and attribute appraisal** ([[LINK LATER: Skill and Attribute Appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=resolution check]]), excluding **sanity appraisal** ([[LINK LATER: Sanity Appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=sanity check]]). The final result is -4 unfavorable, and rounded up. Due to confusion, it may lead to a series of results such as azimuth deviation, spiritual disorder, judgment error, etc.
2. Choose any current **identification** ([[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=identification check]]) **Difficulty Value** ([[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=term | hint=check difficulty]]) (e.g., the Difficulty Value of waking up from a dream) and make the difficulty -4. It is difficult to maintain due to chaos. If you ask to break a wall, the **GM** will give you the Difficulty Value; the Difficulty Value will be reduced and succeeded, and it will be regarded as the wall’s structure being messed up.
3. Select all skill and attribute appraisals within 10 meters of you in 1 round, and produce the effect of ①.
4. Select all identification difficulties generated within 1 round within 10 meters of you as the center, and produce ② effect.
5. Your 1 **movement action** ([[LINK LATER: Movement Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]) can move twice the distance of the **movement force** ([[LINK LATER: Movement Force | type=mechanic | hint=movement distance stat]]), which is regarded as confusing the distance measurement standard, and you can cover a long distance in seven or eight steps.
6. All the above effects are halved for targets higher than 1 character, rounded up.

Special:

[[UNCLEAR: The text says chaos is “limited to ② effects,” but this ability also lists effects ①, ③, ④, and ⑤; it’s unclear whether the limitation applies to the whole ability or only to the reversal logic below.]]

- The essence of chaos is to make stable order chaotic, resulting in mutations, so it is limited to ② effects. If some things are already chaotic enough (such as a lucky appraisal), the difficulty of the appraisal will not decrease but increase; the potion will be promoted so it will be.
- Logic (as given): normal chaos seeks chaos from order to create opportunities. If a thing is already chaotic enough, your purpose is no longer to seek chaos, but to seek order from chaos, then the effect of the ability will be the opposite.

> **GM Note:** Among the effects above, the most manipulable effect is ②, because the rules of extraordinary abilities can also be confused, making the impossible possible. Example: an ability might restrict you to creating only one true/false phantom that can be seen at a glance; once that rule is confused and becomes unstable, this restriction is no longer stable and creating a realistic phantom may become feasible. The GM decides whether this usage is feasible, and it still has similar meaning restrictions: the range of effects before chaos and after chaos cannot be too large. You must have the prerequisite ability (you can’t create something out of nothing). For example, if you “smash the space with a punch,” you simply don’t have the ability to do this—maybe chaos at an older/higher level can.

> (Example caution: [[LINK LATER: Spirit World Travel | type=mechanic | hint=travel ability]] is not closely related to space. It will allow you to travel +4 kilometers at most, including the rest of the [[LINK LATER: Gate Pathway | type=pathway | hint=related abilities]] ability. You can only strengthen the scope of this ability. Please don’t use similar methods just because of this example—ability card bug.)

### Majesty

- **Cost:** None (does not need to consume spirituality)
- **Use:** 1 swift action to turn on/off.
- **Targeting and range:** Creatures within 50 meters that recognize your existence.
- **Duration:** While turned on.
- **Effect:** Your majesty and physique are improved, making surrounding creatures unconsciously lower their bodies and desire to surrender.

Effects:

1. Affected creatures are unfavorable to skill and attribute appraisals by -2, and unconsciously lower their figures. Creatures that are not at the same level as you (Sequence 6-5) will not even be able to look directly at you; at the same level, they will have the urge to lower their heads—this is fear.
2. You are beneficial to the affected creature’s reputation and social identification by +2 ([[LINK LATER: Reputation and Social Identification | type=mechanic | hint=social standing/authority checks]]). This will not affect your assets, but only authority.

Special:

[[UNCLEAR: “Sequence 6-5” is unclear as written (it may indicate a Sequence range or a relative level comparison), so the exact grouping of who can/can’t look directly at you cannot be resolved confidently from this text alone.]]

- Targets 1 level higher than you are unaffected.
- This is the effect brought by the potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.
