# Sequence 0: The Dark Emperor

## The Dark Emperor

Upon successful promotion, **The Dark Emperor** will not truly die until **all nine Secret Tombs** are destroyed.

- Even if The Dark Emperor dies, they can still awaken from **one** of the Secret Tombs and return.
- After destroying all **nine** mausoleums, if the **order established by the god** still has a certain amount of remnants, The Dark Emperor may also be revived in a strange way. This appears to be a loophole of death.

[[UNCLEAR: The RAW alternates between “Dark Emperor” and “Black Emperor” in the same Sequence 0 context without clarifying whether they are the same entity or distinct.]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

(**Promotion Ceremony** in RAW.)

To advance to **Sequence 0**, the candidate must complete all of the following:

- **Own their own country.**
- Ensure that **linking their own name with the title of emperor** becomes common sense among the people.
- Establish a set of **strict and complicated rules** that run contrary to normal conditions, including architectural styles.
- Drive the people to **secretly build nine mausoleums** similar to pyramids.
- Enter one of the mausoleums and take the **Magic Medicine** of **Sequence 0** within the corresponding **sacrificial ceremonies** scattered in different cities that most people participated in.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Death Loophole

- **Effect:** The Dark Emperor does not truly die unless **all nine Secret Tombs** are destroyed.
- **Return:** If they die before all nine are destroyed, they can awaken from **one** Secret Tomb and return.
- **After total destruction:** After all nine mausoleums are destroyed, revival may still occur if the **order established by the god** retains a certain amount of remnants.

### Resurrection Process (Black Emperor)

There are **three stages** in the resurrection process of the **Black Emperor**.

- The “Black Emperor” of sex reappeared in the [[LINK LATER: Star Realm | type=location | hint=cosmological realm]].
- The **three Sequence 1 Extraordinary Characteristics** automatically returned to their emperors.
- This is an order that **no other true god** can reverse or stop.

[[UNCLEAR: The RAW states there are “three stages” but only provides partial/uncertain stage details, including the phrase “of sex,” which is not interpretable with confidence.]]
