# Black Emperor Pathway: Sequence 0

## Black Emperor

Upon successful promotion, **The Dark Emperor** will not truly die until **all nine Secret Tombs** are destroyed.

- Even if The Dark Emperor dies, they can still awaken from **one** of the Secret Tombs and return.
- After destroying all **nine** mausoleums, if the **order established by the god** still has a certain amount of remnants, The Dark Emperor may also be revived in a strange way. This appears to be a loophole of death.

Note: "Dark Emperor" and "Black Emperor" are treated as the same entity/alias.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

(**Promotion Ceremony** in RAW.)

To advance to **Sequence 0**, the candidate must complete all of the following:

- **Own their own country.**
- Ensure that **linking their own name with the title of emperor** becomes common sense among the people.
- Establish a set of **strict and complicated rules** that run contrary to normal conditions, including architectural styles.
- Drive the people to **secretly build nine mausoleums** similar to pyramids.
- Enter one of the mausoleums and take the **Magic Medicine** of **Sequence 0** within the corresponding **sacrificial ceremonies** scattered in different cities that most people participated in.
