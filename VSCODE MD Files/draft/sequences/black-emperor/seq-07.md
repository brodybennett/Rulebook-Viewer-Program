# Sequence 7: The Briber

## Advancement

### Main Materials

- **Main Materials:** "Crying Baby" flower; strange face marijuana crystal

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:** 5 drops of golden mandala juice; 5 drops of black mandala juice; 4 drops of psychedelic grass essential oil; 80 ml of red wine

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** strength +1; constitution +1; agility +1; inspiration +1
- Your **law and deceit** skill increases by 1 level.
- At the same time, the upper limit of your Sequence 9 Rapid Improvement skill has reached advanced level.

### Bribe

- **Cost:** 3 points of [[Spirituality]]
- **Targeting and range:** Maximum of 1 target affected at a time.
- **Use:** You must accompany the effect with an act of giving things (an actual or symbolic “bribe”).
- **Effect:** If any one of the following activation methods succeeds (see restrictions), you choose **one** bribe type (benefit) to apply.

#### Activation Methods

1. **Throwing**
   - Make a confrontation against the target’s [[Physical Defense]].
   - As long as the target cannot avoid “light/lightning,” the ability takes effect even if the Identification fails, but it does not cause damage.
   - If the target can avoid “light/lightning,” it only takes effect when it cannot dodge; the ability also takes effect if the Identification fails.
   - Additional restrictions:
     - The throw must be made at the target within [[Throwing Range]].
     - The confrontation can only be established (as written), and it can be blocked by others first.

2. **Giving**
   - Simply give the object to the target. If the target takes it, the bribe takes effect.
   - This method is difficult to guard against.

3. **Suggestion**
   - You write or say a suggestion. If the target reads it and acts according to the suggestion, the bribe takes effect.
   - Additional restrictions:
     - The two suggestions are independent of each other: you can’t advise others “don’t listen to me next,” then use later suggestions to manipulate them.
     - If the advice you give is what the other party is going to do, it is not considered a bribe.

#### Object Restrictions (Throwing and Giving)

- The object must be substantial and must be given by you.
- Giving multiple objects triggers only one bribe (multiple objects are treated as a whole when given).
- Guns, bows, and arrows are not considered bribes, because the mechanical movement of props ≠ you.

#### Benefit Slots

- Each bribe type below is a separate ability/benefit.
- Through [[Extraordinary Items]], [[Grazing]], etc., each bribe occupies a [[Benefit Slot]].
- No matter what bribe type you choose, the activation methods (Throwing/Giving/Suggestion) work the same way, and only the Briber enjoys the benefits.

#### Bribe Types

##### Bribe—Weakening

You weaken the target’s attack, defense, or control **against yourself** for a certain period of time. Choose one:

1. **Weaken Attack**
   - Damage caused by the target to the Briber is halved (round up).
   - This includes bullets and other effects that do not include the attacker’s subjective intention.

2. **Weaken Defense**
   - When the Briber takes any action against the target, the target’s Three Defenses and [[Confrontation Check]]s are -4 disadvantageous.

3. **Weaken Control**
   - Only affects control effects on the Briber, including [[Dream]], [[Epidemic]], [[Deterrence]], etc.
   - For “takes effect” checks or “break free” checks made via Identification:
     - The difficulty of the Identification requirement is halved (round up).
   - For effects with marked durations, reduce duration as follows:
     - 1 week → 1 day  
     - 1 day → 1 hour  
     - 1 hour → 5 minutes  
     - 5 minutes → an encounter  
     - an encounter → multiple rounds  
     - multiple rounds → 1 round  
     - 1 round → only take effect for 1 round
     - (Dreams, epidemics, and other control effects without a clearly marked duration are not included.)
   - For “Lost Actions” style effects:
     - Effects that cannot perform actions → can perform 1 cast/attack/move **or** 2 swifts
     - Effects that lose 2 actions → lose 1 action
     - Effects that lose 1 action → can only perform 1 Swift Action
     - Only 1 Swift Action → becomes invalid
   - Special cases of “Lost Actions” (and other similar situations) are decided by the GM with reference to:
     1. [[Spirit Body Thread Manipulation]]  
        - You can still advance the manipulation progress as usual, but the effect of the extended action is reduced by 2 levels.  
        - Minimum: you can only perform 1 freedom per round.  
        - After being fully secreted, it is still considered dead and cannot perform actions.
     2. [[Possession]]  
        - In addition to casting spells, the possessed person can choose to attack/move as usual.
   - If a control effect meets multiple conditions at the same time, it suffers all reductions above.  
     - Example: shock changes from “last for 1 round, lose 1 action” to “last for 1 round, and only perform 1 Swift Action in 1 round.”

##### Bribe—Charisma (CHA)

You instill strong liking, making it difficult for the target to show hostile intent, or even willing to fight you.

1. The target cannot attack you until you lose all teammates, and has a strong affection for you from the heart.
2. You are favorable to +4 for their charisma-related Identification.
3. If the target is not hostile or vigilant toward you, then once you succeed in an Identification related to charm, they immediately obey you. From then on, they can only attack targets that are hostile to you, including your own companions.

##### Bribe—Arrogance

You make the target proud and arrogant, mentally lowered, and misjudged.

1. The target immediately feels proud and arrogant. The GM should add a series of untrue information beneficial to them (from their perspective) to create an “advantage filter.”
   - Their skills and attribute Identification are +2 beneficial, but this is just an illusion. Actual -2.
2. Based on (1), the target’s big failure probability is expanded: the basic value of rd20 rolls of 1, 2, and 3 are all big failures.
3. Clarification: the above effects only affect one target of the Briber; the “filter” only takes effect on that target.

##### Bribe—Relationship

You establish a connection between two parties.

1. You continuously know the target’s location.
   - This does not mean shared senses. You only know a specific location and distance, so you don’t know the name of the place they are going to unless you already know enough about it.
2. You are considered to have established a mystical connection:
   - You can perform [[id:alias-divination|Divination]] with [[No-Clue Scrying]] (you gain the qualifications but no extra benefits).
   - This is not considered having flesh and blood, so you cannot get a completely successful result.
   - You can’t [[Curse]].
   - Divination for the same thing will still only get the same result until new clues are obtained.

## When the bribed target is higher than Sequence 1

When this condition applies, modify the chosen bribe type as follows:

1. **Bribe—Weakening**
   - **Weaken Attack:** Changes to final damage reduction of 1d10.
   - **Weaken Defense:** Effect is halved.
   - **Weaken Control:**  
     - Identification difficulty becomes -5.  
     - Duration is only halved from the original basis (round up). Example: an effect that lasts 1 week becomes 4 days (instead of 1 day).  
     - Lost actions: regardless of what is lost, the target solidly performs 1 Swift Action per round; but if the original effect is that you can only perform 1 Swift Action, then it is hardly weakened.

2. **Bribe—Charisma (CHA)**
   - The target still has certain affection for you, but whether they attack you depends on their own will.
   - Your Charisma check against them is halved.
   - The effect that pleases you and may even attack teammates can no longer be generated.

3. **Bribe—Arrogance**
   - The target immediately becomes aware the “advantage filter” is false; the reduction effect is halved.
   - Big failure expansion changes from 1, 2, 3 to only 1, 2.

4. **Bribe—Relationship**
   - The moment the relationship is successfully established, the target immediately perceives this without Identification.
   - If the other party is unwilling, your No-Clue Scrying is -8 disadvantageous.
