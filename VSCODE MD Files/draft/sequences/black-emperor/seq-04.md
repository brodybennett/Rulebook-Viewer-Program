# Black Emperor Pathway: Sequence 4

## Mentor of Disorder

- At this **Sequence**, your **Distortion** and **Gift** undergo a qualitative change.
- You can “use” rules (**Exploitation**), “magnify” effects (**Zoom In**), and “chaos” order (**Chaos**) to create conditions favorable to yourself.
- You can delineate an area and tamper with, increase, or apply certain rules to create a fighting environment beneficial to yourself.
- You can directly gift a negative state to a target, causing outcomes such as:
  - becoming passive and slow at work,
  - becoming greedy and eager,
  - losing fighting spirit,
  - focusing only on money.
- Through **Zoom In**, **Exploitation**, and **Distortion**, you can (to a certain extent) do things normally only possible for the [[Justiciar]].
- You also retain [[Bribery]] and other mid-to-low Sequence extraordinary abilities; they are stronger at this Sequence.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Let the order stipulated by a country be reversed in the opposite and distorted direction, so that the expected effect will be magnified geometrically, the direction will deviate from the original track, and it will develop in an unknown direction, and finally obtain huge profits. (unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +1, Agility (DEX) +1, Intuition (INT) +1, Charisma +2; your legal skill goes up by one skill level.

  You confuse the form of an object. Choose an object to add an affix to. The affix

- **Cost:** Consume 5 **Spirit points**.
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action** to cast one of the supernatural effects below. Once per round, you can cast one of the following effects as a **free action**; the free action still requires the listed cost and replaces the Casting Action.
- **Effect:** Choose one of the following supernatural effects:

— **Confusion (Distortion):** You confuse the form of an object.
- Choose an object to add an **affix** to.
- The affix produces a certain physical effect, but it must conform to the shape of the marked object and cannot add a prefix that contradicts the object’s original attributes.
- Examples:
  - You can add “very short” to the distance between you and a streetlight.
  - You can add “disrepair” to a house.
  - You can’t add “easy to ignite” to water.
- Contradictory affixes overwrite earlier affixes you added:
  - If you add “very short” to the distance between you and the streetlight, adding “very far” immediately after overrides the effect you just added.
- You cannot use this to warp any extraordinary ability, nor can you directly add affixes to living creatures.
  - You may be able to indirectly affect the outcome of an extraordinary ability by distorting the object affected by that extraordinary ability. Target validity (including abstract targets like distance/relationship) is GM-defined.

> **GM Note:** About the deepening application of chaos: for a demigod of the Black Emperor Pathway, this kind of distortion should actually be called “chaos.” In essence, it causes a certain degree of chaos in the order, and this can be used logically. For demigods, using “chaos” to shorten the distance between two points is the norm. You can use chaos to walk a few hundred meters in two or three steps (e.g., from a manor garden to the manor hall). You can also use this ability to make an item shorten the distance between each other and reach you directly in hand or in your designated area. You can also pull away or close the distance between you and an enemy—retreating a few hundred meters in two or three steps, or shrinking an enemy hundreds of meters away so they reach your palm. You can also perform indiscriminate chaos in a closed enchantment: by the law of mysticism, a closed space must have an exit, and this exit will not be easily affected—so if you do indiscriminate chaos, that which is not affected by the chaos is the outlet.

— **Exploitation (Use):** You keep a certain state longer or end earlier, making the rules more beneficial to you.
- You can make a negative or positive state disappear instantly, or make it last up to 10 times longer.
- The increased duration cannot be superimposed.
- You can extend the duration of three negative states at the same time.
- This is not limited to a certain buff; as long as something is “in a state,” this ability can be used.
- Examples and applications:
  - If you jump up, you can use the short-term “leaving the ground” state to achieve the effect of “flying.”
  - For such common-sense physical properties, the extension time is not limited to ten times; it only needs to be used once, and it will be useful for almost the entire battle.
  - You can use this on an item that has been strengthened or is in a short “shooting” state to make it automatically and continuously shoot; the strengthening buff can make it last forever.
  - A bonus limited to taking effect only once can be extended to ten times by you. There can’t be a gap in the middle, because this is making an effect last longer, not increasing the number of times.
  - If the “flying” from jumping or a continuous strengthening is eliminated mid-way (e.g., the effect stops in the middle of ten times of strengthening, or you cancel “flying” and fall to the ground), you must use the ability again once to make it take effect again.
- Note on firearms:
  - Using a gun in the “shooting” state does not mean it becomes a Gatling; at most it can automatically shoot without a person.
  - Even if the shooting state is prolonged, the bullet supply is still limited; once bullets are fired, a gun without bullets will only fire “air bullets” even if it continues to shoot.
- Sequence reference:
  - Sequence 2: Strengthened so that it can jump directly from the ground to the red moon. This principle is consistent with the above description.

— **Zoom In (Magnification):** Choose one of the following effects to take effect:
- +5 to one of your skill checks.
- One of your attack or damage rolls increases by 5d6.
- The skill effect of one of your extraordinary abilities is increased by one Sequence level (if any).
  - This can affect the personality of an item.
  - Your **Extraordinary items** are also considered your extraordinary ability.
  - You can increase Sequence 5 items by one Sequence level, letting their effect reach Sequence 4.
  - This will not newly acquire the skills of Sequence 4, but only affects the strength of the item’s ability.
  - In this way, you can use the extraordinary items of Sequence 5 in a demigod battle, and can make them be used normally without being suppressed by the person through amplification; the items of Sequence 5 are put into the battle of demigods.
- You amplify the negative effect of the extraordinary item in your hand, doubling it in all directions, which is the same as effect ③ (increase the extraordinary ability by one Sequence level).
- You amplify a reasonable action to achieve a stronger effect, which is determined by the **GM**.
  - Examples: turn an ordinary blow into an “execution”; turn an air hug at a distance into a “shackle”; pull back with hands separated by several meters to straighten the target directly in front of the target.
- Skills affected by the “magnification” effect will take effect regardless of distance and objective conditions, can produce stronger consequences, and can have stronger influence.
- Amplified skills can only be used on yourself according to their effect description, and usually cannot be exempted from this restriction by adding affixes.
  - Exception: if a target can be equal to yourself in a practical sense (such as the [[Secret Puppet of the Worm]] in Sequence 4, or a person who is deeply [[Parasitized]]), then this effect can take effect on other targets of this type in this case.
- For the extraordinary items you carry, the improvement of the skill effect can take effect.

> **Lore:** In expression, zoom in can turn a flower into a cannonball. You throw a flower lightly; its speed accelerates suddenly, and the effect of “bribery” can even be added at the same time. The bouquet—like a sharp arrow—tears the air and blasts the ground into a huge crater. Even a light punch can be magnified into a fatal blow.

— **Gift (Unreasonable Gift):** Give a target something that happened to you.
- **Bestowed Thought:** On the target’s next turn, it performs the action you specify, which cannot be clearly against its will.
  - Special: Visionary Sequence 4 and above ignore this ability.
- **Bestow Negative Status:** You give a negative status on your body to the opponent.
- **Gift of Madness:** You gift your madness to the opponent.
- Extra (negative status gifting):
  - The actual situation can also make people passive and slow down, or greedy and eager, or lose fighting spirit, or only focus on money.
- The performance of demigods at the same level is to make the other party’s next identification -5.
- By using this effect, the -5 applies to the target’s next identification for 1 round, and it can also be resisted by extraordinary abilities.

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
