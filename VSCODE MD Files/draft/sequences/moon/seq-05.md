# Viscount Bloodline Pathway: Sequence 5

## Crimson Scholar

- See also: [[Viscount Bloodline Pathway]]

There are two core abilities:
- Create an environment beneficial to yourself by creating a â€œfull moonâ€ effect or hiding the moon.
- Within a certain range illuminated by moonlight, gain the ability to teleport/flash and enter a moonlight state; even if crushed by someone, you can be reassembled in the moonlight.

The strength of these abilities depends on your understanding and research of the â€œMoonâ€ field. Darkness spells become stronger, potions are more effective, and you gain resistance to nightmare effects. [[Nightmare effects]]

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials (unofficial examples):** Metals, gemstones, and blood of supernatural beings representing different moon states.

**Metal (moon symbol, mysticism):**
- Pure silver (about 10â€“40 grams)

**Gemstones (moon symbol, occultism):**

| Gemstone (collective name) | Corresponding moon phase |
|---|---|
| Star moon stone | New moon |
| Crescent stone | Crescent moon |
| Upper string stone | First quarter moon |
| Full convex stone | Waxing gibbous |
| Moonstone | Full moon |
| Wan convex stone | Waning gibbous |
| Lower string stone | Last quarter moon |
| Waning moon stone | Waning moon |
| Garnet | New moon |

**Extraordinary biological blood (moon symbol, occultism):**
- The blood of Pegasus
- The crown jellyfish
- The blood of creatures living around the fountain of elves
- The blood of vampires or artificial vampires

> **GM Note:** Ritual gem description:
> - Because there are many branches of gemstones symbolizing a single moon phase (e.g., more than one gemstone can symbolize the new moon or first quarter moon), the moon-phase name is used collectively here. You may buy several different kinds, but any one that meets the requirement can symbolize that moon phaseâ€”choose one.
> - Because the astronomical moon phase is a cycle, a full cycle requires two different gems that symbolize the â€œnew moon,â€ so they can connect end to end. (Analogy given: if gathering â€œEast Risingâ€ for the sun, you would need two â€œEast Risingâ€ to meet a cycle.)
> - In the gemstone list, the first and last gems are intended to fulfill the â€œtwo new moonâ€ requirement (e.g., star moon stone and garnet), so there is no need to buy two star moon stones separatelyâ€”use the list to buy.
> - Use the phase mapping where the first and last gemstones represent the **new moon** (not crescent moon) to close the cycle.

> **GM Note:** Price guidance (setting-facing):
> - Average unit price of metals and gems is not expensive in the Lord of Mysteries worldview.
> - A single gem will not exceed 1â€“2 pounds if the need is not much.
> - Because extraordinary creature blood is not the main material, costs are reduced; you can collect them for about 50â€“100 pounds.
> - Under normal circumstances, total consumption will not exceed 100 pounds.
> - The point is there is no market price: gems/metals can be found in a few different jewelry stores on average; blood can be collected by attending a few extraordinary parties (common material).

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Under the light of the full moon, gather enough metals, gemstones, and blood of supernatural beings representing different moon states.

> **Lore:** Role-playing rules: devoutly like the moon, worship the moon, study the moon.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1, Inspiration +2. [[Inspiration]]

### Moon Knowledge (Skill)

A special knowledge skill is trained: **Moon Knowledge**. [[Moon Knowledge]]  
This skill belongs to the educational skill, is included in the rapid growth category of Sequence 9, and can be quickly promoted to proficiency at most. [[Sequence 9 rapid growth category]]

### Sleep-Related Resistance

From now on, against attempts to force you with sleep-related abilities:
- If no identification is required, the user must use **Inspiration** to fight against your **Will Defense** for the effect to take hold. [[Will Defense]]
- If identification is required, your **Countermeasure** or **Will Defense** +4 is beneficial. [[Countermeasure]]

### Summon Full Moon

- **Use:** 1 **swift action**. [[Swift Action]]
- **Cost:** 3 points of **spirituality**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Targeting and range:** Affecting an area within a few hundred meters.
- **Effect:** You unleash a crimson moonglow (a â€œfull moonâ€ effect), or cause the moon to disappear into the sky. At this time, it is regarded as a full moon state. All creatures illuminated by the moonlight, and all identifications related to **Inspiration**, gain +1.

**Moon Knowledge scaling**
- For every â€œLunar lore levelâ€ you have (i.e., Moon Knowledge level), all checks related to **Inspiration** get an additional +1 on top of the base +1 from moonlight.
- Thus, while your Lunar lore is **Trained**, all friendly creatures gain +2 to Inspiration-related checks.

**Advantages of other full moon astronomical phenomena**
1. **Extra spirituality:** Under the full moon, everyone who is illuminated can get 1d6 temporary extra spirituality; during a blood moon, they can get 2d6 temporary extra spirituality. [[Blood Moon]]
2. The Crimson Scholar of **Sequence 5** can add an additional amount of spirituality equal to **+1 per Moon Knowledge level** on top of this base value.

> **GM Note:** When polluted by the primordial moon, or when the transcendent of the moon path is a believer of the primordial moon (Fallen Goddess), the moon summoned by it is mostly a blood-red full moon. [[Primordial Moon]] [[Fallen Goddess]]

#### Moonlight Coverage by Sequence (Future Sequences)

- **Sequence 4:** Moonlight can cover a range with a radius of one kilometer, suppressing Sequence 5 and below the sun path brilliance, and last one encounter under the natural sun. (Brightness of Sequence 5 and below can still illuminate, but it can no longer cover up the moonlight, cannot completely dispel darkness and shadows, and can still illuminate traces of ghosts, and the same applies to subsequent upgrades) [[Sun Path brilliance]]
- **Sequence 3:** Moonlight can cover a city and cover the natural sun for half an hour, but it cannot suppress Sequence 4's sun path brilliance.
- **Sequence 2:** If you want, it can cover half a continent, can cover the natural sunlight and last for 12 hours of full moon radiance, suppress the sun path brilliance spell below sequence 2.
- **Sequence 1:** The radiance of the full moon that can cover the entire continent and last for 24 hours, cannot suppress the sun path brilliance of Sequence 2.

### Moonlight

- **Use:** 1 **swift action**.
- **Cost and duration:** Every 3 points of **spirituality** lasts for 1 round.
- **Limits (requirement):** You must be within the range of moonlight to use it.
- **Effect:** You become a beam of moonlight. Your body is broken into crimson moonlight fragments; you are regarded as being in a **moonlight state** and gain the following benefits:

1. **Reorganization:** Whenever your health value is reduced to 0, if you are in the moonlight you recover 2d6 life and transform into the moonlight form, provided that:
   - you have not been hit by the heart,
   - attackers are at disadvantage to hit the heart, or
   - you are hit by heart to die.  
   [[Hit by the heart]]  
   This also applies under holy attack as long as you are under moonlight, and the holy attack is not greater than 1 character above you.

2. **Movement:** In the moonlight state:
   - You gain the ability to fly.
   - You are immune to physical/toxin damage.
   - You will not be affected by environmental effects (such as heat/cold).
   - You are considered invisible.
   - You will not be hit by the vitals. [[Vitals]]
   - Only a single-target attack that locks your position, or a ranged attack can attack you; otherwise it will pass through your body.

3. **Discovery:** Destiny, Mystic Eye, and Puppet Master's Spiritual Line Vision can all locate you. [[Destiny]] [[Mystic Eye]] [[Puppet Master's Spiritual Line Vision]]  
   Trying to discover your location requires a successful spiritual intuition identification. Normal detection of invisible creatures is not applicable to you. [[Spiritual Intuition identification]]

4. **Action:** In the moonlight state:
   - You can only perform movement actions and free actions.
   - You can fly and move a distance equal to your movement force. [[Movement Force]]
   - You cannot perform quick/attack/casting actions.
   - You can use the extraordinary ability of the flash of the moon (see **Lunar Blink**).

**Moon Knowledge improvement**
- Each level of Moon Knowledge provides an additional chance to reorganize, and this reorganization will not consume spirituality.
- If you suffer a holy blow in the moonlight state, you will be forced to reorganize because the surrounding moonlight disappears, and you will be transformed back to the original form. This forcefully consumes your spirituality or reorganization opportunities; if not, it consumes your sanity. [[Sanity]]
- Holy Strikes that are **one character** or **two sequence levels** below you can't do this. [[Holy Strike]]

**If the moonlight does not fully illuminate the entire scene**
- You will be targeted by single-target attacks due to your limited range of movement or being too visible as a lone moonlight, provided the enemy is aware of your presence.
- In this case, summoning 1 full moon will usually solve the problem in this regard.

### Lunar Blink

- **Use:** 1 **swift action**; 1 time per round.
- **Cost:** 3 points of **spirituality**.
- **Effect:** You are broken into crimson moonlight fragments. Choose a distance not exceeding your movement power, flash to the corresponding position, and reorganize into a human form at the corresponding position. [[Movement Power]]

1. **Reactive use:** If you use this ability when you are about to be attacked, you can jump like a flame, directly avoiding the attack on your current position. You cannot avoid light/lightning with this; you must flash out of the range for ranged attacks.

2. **Moon Knowledge scaling:** Every time you increase the level of Moon Knowledge, your flashable distance increases:
   - Trained = your mobility
   - Proficient = twice your mobility
   - Advanced = your triple mobility
   - and so on.

3. **Incompatibility:** High-speed movement and Moon Flash cannot be used at the same time, so it cannot increase the flash distance for you. [[High-speed movement]]

**Additional scaling**
- Every time a sequence level is increased: the mobile power multiplier of the teleportation flash of each moon knowledge level +1.
- Every upgrade of 1 character: the mobile power multiplier of the teleportation flash of each moon knowledge level +2.
- These multipliers stack on top of the Trained/Proficient/Advanced mobility scheme.

### Potion Effect Enhancement

This is an ability enhancement brought by the sequence; it is not regarded as a separate extraordinary ability, but is listed specifically.

From now on, every time you make a magic potion, choose one of the following benefits to upgrade to the potion:
1. **Attribute/Armor/Reduction Improving Potion:** Benefits from attribute enhancement +1.
2. **Harmful potions:** Increase damage by 1d6. If the potion of destruction is a mixed effect of multiple types of damage, all types of damage will increase by 1d6, but the intensity must be agreed by your **GM**. [[Potion of destruction]]
3. **Special effect potions:** For example, invisibility/odorless potions can gain additional bonuses; the favorable tendency should be related to the effects of the potions. For example, invisibility may be confronted by detection, so it can make stealth identification extra +2 beneficial. [[Stealth identification]]
4. **Potions with negative effects:** Potions with negative effects (e.g., fire dragon breathing cannot speak). You can clear this less serious effect. Other effects (such as use time limit): you can consider halving the value and rounding up. [[Fire dragon breathing]]
5. **Other benefits:** Your **GM** must agree to the final effect of your medicine.
