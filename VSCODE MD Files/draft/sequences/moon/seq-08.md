# Sequence 8: Beast Tamer

> **Lore:** Domesticate and use living animals, including extraordinary creatures; greatly improve physical fitness.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main Material:** [[Medulla Crystal of the Spring of Elves]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +2, Agility +2.
- Your animal taming uses Sequence 9 rapid growth rules: cap at **Proficient**, and each non-repeating tame counts as 1 growth.

### Animal Senses

- **Cost:** 3 [[Spiritual Points]]
- **Use:** 1 [[Casting Action]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 animal / extraordinary creature / insect (even mosquito) within 20 meters.
- **Check:** Tame the beast against its [[Will Defense]]
- **Effect:** If you succeed, you share the senses with it and gain the effects below for 5 minutes.
- **Limits:**
  - The following effects cannot be more than 100 meters away from the animal.
  - It can complete the instructions even if it is more than 100 meters away.

#### Effects

1. **Communicating animals:** You can let you understand each other directly without words, and let it act instead of you.
2. **Share the senses:** Directly see what it sees/hears. Even if the other party’s vision (such as mosquitoes) works differently from humans, the picture in front of you can be recombined into a scene that you understand, which may lead you to share [[Sanity Loss]].
3. **Drive animals:** In battle, the actions of animals are independent of you, and you can maintain inspired animals equal to your **Inspiration**; they share senses at the same time.
   - Non-intelligent animals can usually be regarded as your subordinates directly after the successful identification of animal taming, and provide you with benefits. [[Animal Taming Identification]]
4. **Auxiliary Potion:** When you share the senses with an intelligent animal:
   - A common animal imposes a **-4 penalty** to the target’s [[Sanity Loss Identification]].
   - Only when your Sequence level is greater than it, the **animal** receives a -2 benefit when it is promoted.
   - If the creature’s [[Pathway]] is the same as yours, gain an additional -2 benefit.
   - You can also get this benefit if you are 1 Sequence higher than it.

#### Special

- Extraordinary creatures that already have intelligence and have not been domesticated by you (animals after taking potions): if they are not higher than your Sequence, when you intend to domesticate them, they will fall into a state of fear of you, feeling as if encountered a natural enemy.
- A creature that has been fully domesticated by you, even if you lose this ability, will still obey your orders.
  - However, animals without intelligence may cause you to no longer be able to give instructions to it.

### Domesticated Animal Examples

> **GM Note:** Defaults for regular animals that may be domesticated.

#### List of regular animals that may be domesticated

1. **Bugs/ants:**
   - By default, they die when they are hit.
   - Only fast-moving bugs can calculate physical defense against (such as mosquitoes), with 10 points of physical defense (10 agility), and fast dodge.
   - Faced with range/psychic damage, they will die directly by default.
2. **Rats/birds:**
   - 2d2 HP.
   - 5 points in [[Three Defenses]] (both attributes are 2).
3. **Cat/Dog:**
   - 7+1d3 HP.
   - 8 points in Three Defenses (all attributes are 3).
4. **Young lion/tiger/large dog:**
   - 10+2d3 HP.
   - 15 Three Defenses (all attributes are 5).
5. **Adult lion/tiger/bear/bull:**
   - 20 HP.
   - 18 Three Defenses (both attributes are 8).

#### Domestication conditions

- Non-intelligent / [[Semi-crazy]] creatures can be domesticated by you for a long time by default.
- Other creatures must be voluntary if you want to domesticate them for a long time.

#### Long-term domesticated animal character cards

- If the **Player** is willing, it can be a long-term domesticated animal character card.
- The attributes refer to the list above, or you can draw up your own.
- The HP above determines the basic HP of the creature.
- The Three Defenses except the attributes determine the basic defense of the species.
- If the above attributes have more than 6 points, it means that its upper limit of attributes is higher than that of human beings.
- Turning a creature into a character card may cause the attributes to be inferior to the above simple calculation, but it means that it truly becomes a character.
- In the case that the basic defense/life does not match that of humans:
  - You can fill in the corresponding data in the extra life/defense of the character card with additional values,
  - or negative values to dynamically adjust.

> **GM Note:** More creatures can be referenced in the [[Injury/Health Volume Example]]. The value is determined by the GM. Animal trainers who want to patrol bears/lions and other dangerous creatures need the consent of the GM, and raising such creatures requires at least a [[Credit Rating]] order.
