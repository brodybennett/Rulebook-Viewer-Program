# Queen of Blood Race Pathway: Sequence 1

## Beauty Goddess

> **Lore:** This Sequence embodies the power of the feminine; appearance and charm are described as its greatest strengths.

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Create a civilization that can exist for a long time and is famous for its beauty.  
  > **GM Note:** Labeled as an “unofficial ceremony” in the RAW.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Charm** [[Charm]] +4. [[UNCLEAR: RAW says Charm cannot be measured numerically, but also grants +4 and later references controlling a Charm value.]]
- If a male **Beyonder** is promoted to this **Sequence**, they become female.

### The Power of Beauty

- **Cost:** 1 **Free Action** [[Free Action]] to activate (“open”).
- **Duration:** Permanent.
- **Effect:**
  - You become a symbol of the concept of “beauty.”
  - You can control any **Charm** [[Charm]] value you want.
  - You can freely physically fit yourself into different charms of women of different ages and styles; these traits can change and can coexist perfectly.
  - Inanimate objects animate under your authority, working tirelessly in your praise.
  - Intelligent life falls in love with you in many forms (appreciation, longing, etc.).

> **Lore:** “Beauty is your greatest weapon.”

- **First Sight (Beyonders):** A **Beyonder** who sees your appearance for the first time, and whose **Pathway** **Sequence** is lower than yours, must make a **Will Test** [[Will Test]] with **Difficulty Value** [[Difficulty Value]] 20 + (Sequence level difference).
  - **Failure:** If the target is one Sequence level lower than you, they immediately lose all fighting spirit, and may even become your puppet permanently. [[Puppet]]
  - **Success:** The target can use only 1 **Free Action** [[Free Action]] and 1 **Action** [[Action]] each **Round** [[Round]], and their skills, attributes, and damage evaluations are all at a -4 disadvantage.

- **Same Personality Clause:** Enemies with the same personality as you will only lose one action and suffer disadvantages. They can resist with a corresponding **Will Test** [[Will Test]] every round; on success, they do not suffer the corresponding effect, but must make the corresponding Will Test again in the next round as long as they are facing the God of Beauty. [[UNCLEAR: “same personality” is undefined; the exact “disadvantages” here are not quantified; “identify it every round” is unclear in meaning and procedure.]]

### Life Authority

- **Effect:** From now on, all authority related to life creation and improvement requires only 1 **Free Action** [[Free Action]]. [[Life Authority]]
