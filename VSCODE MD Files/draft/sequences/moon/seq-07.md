# Moon Pathway: Sequence 7

## Vampire (Blood Adult)

- Obtain a long life, excellent physique, excellent appearance, and master a variety of dark spells.  
  **Blood adult** means a mature bloodline stage.

- See also: [[Moon Pathway]], [[Sequence 8]], [[id:alias-sequence-6|Sequence 6]]

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main material:** The blood essence corresponding to the bloodline of **Sequence 7**.
- **Replacement:** The main material of the subsequent **Sequence** can be replaced by the bloodline “legacy” of the corresponding **Sequence** (GM decides what qualifies as bloodline legacy).

> **GM Note:** This main material does not originate from an extraordinary creature, but a vampire. If changing from **Sequence 8** to **Sequence 7**, it usually means you must hunt a vampire to become an artificial vampire, or accept **First Embrace**. [[Artificial Vampire]] [[First Embrace]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +2, Dexterity +2, Charm +2, Inspiration +1.
- Your [[Mysticism]] is included in your rapid growth category, up to [[Proficiency]].
- Skill growth of [[Sequence 9]] follows Sequence 9 rapid growth rules: cap at **Proficient**, with **2/3/4** growths to reach training/proficiency/advanced; you may begin learning toward **Erudition**.

### Extraordinary Sense of Smell

- **Type:** Racial alteration; cannot be recorded/stolen.
- **Cost:** 1 free action.
- **Use:** Passive ability that is actively triggered.
- **Effect:** Choose 1 of the following benefits to take effect:

  1. **Distinguishing smell:** You can directly discern the smell in the air, and discern the approximate composition of what you know. If this involves certain chemical or professional fields, it may require a Difficulty Value 15 chemistry/pharmaceutical/mysterious scientific identification.
     - You can also know what is inside through a barrier through smell, provided that you know the corresponding smell.
  2. **Invisible detection:** You can directly detect the existence of spirits or invisible creatures within 20 meters, and you can launch a normal attack on invisible creatures without a detection test. If you cover up the smell, you can immediately detect and resist stealth, unless the smell is completely wiped out.
     - Normal creatures and ghosts have different smells, so you can identify the approximate creature type of the target.
  3. **Spotting tracking:** If a creature is following you within 20 meters, you can use the detection test to counter its stealth every 5 minutes. If you succeed, you will find that the scent of the creature has not disappeared based on its smell, so you can find the tracking.
  4. **Grasp the smell:** Remember the smell of a creature; as long as its distance is not more than 20 meters and the smell is not covered, you can keep track of its position. This can also be directly used to identify whether there is a person/corpse in an area, and how many people.

- **Special:** If there is a pungent smell/stink in the sensory range, it causes a continuous -2 disadvantage to your skill and attribute assessment, and you feel uncomfortable due to your overly sensitive sense of smell. Because this ability has passive factors, this applies whether you use the ability or not.
- **Sequence scaling:**
  - **Sequence 6:** Effective distance becomes 30 meters.
  - **Sequence 5:** Effective distance becomes 50 meters.

### Extraordinary Life

- **Type:** Racial change; cannot be recorded/stolen.
- **Effect:**
  1. Your lifespan increases to 300 years, and you have dark vision. You can see in the dark like ordinary people.
  2. You are regarded as a dark creature. You don't like the sun, and you feel uncomfortable in the sun, but this is role-playing only; there are no additional special effects.
  3. You start to take blood rich in spirituality as your staple food. The blood of well-preserved living creatures usually has spirituality. Normal food can bring you limited nutrition. At least two of the three meals a day should be related to blood.
     - If you don’t eat blood for 3 days, it’s like the hunger of a normal human being: you will be in a state of exhaustion, you will lose 1 casting/attack/moving action, or 2 swift actions, and you will have an additional -2 disadvantage in skill and attribute evaluation.
- **Sequence scaling:**
  - **Sequence 6** and **Sequence 5:** The lifespan of each **Sequence** is increased by 100 years.
  - **Sequence 4:** The limit lifespan is increased to 1200 years; the situation is normal for the first 1000 years. After 1000 years, there will be a gradual decline in physical condition, irreversible old age, and the decline and decay of the spirit body.

> **Lore:** Belief in the [[Primordial Moon (Fallen Mother Goddess)]] will further extend lifespan.

### High-Speed Movement

- **Type:** Racial advantage; cannot be recorded/stolen.
- **Effect:** Your movement speed can be so fast that you can drag out afterimages.

  1. **Fast dodge:** You rely on speed to retain full physical defense against firearms; light/lightning bypasses this protection. You also get an extra level of dodge.
  2. **Drag out afterimage:** 1 swift action, once per round, only when moving on land; your action drags out afterimages.
     - The essence of the high-speed movement ability is that the Agility attribute is temporarily +1, but the high-speed movement can only temporarily take effect on one action. Every time you use this ability, choose 1 of the following purposes:
       - +1 to a skill check involving Dexterity or a Dexterity-related skill.
       - +1 movement for a move action.
         - +1 to the Agility value within physical defense (physical defense is 10 + Agility + dodge + armor).
          - This benefit allows you to avoid light/lightning by leaving the area in time.
     - Because movement is composed of Strength + Agility, since Agility +1, movement becomes Strength + Agility +1 (i.e., movement +1).

- **Sequence scaling:** For each promotion **Sequence**, the temporary Agility bonus increases by +1 (Sequence 6 is +2, Sequence 5 is +3, and so on).

### Extraordinary Regeneration

- **Type:** Racial advantage; cannot be recorded/stolen.
- **Effect:**
  1. **High-speed regeneration:** Every time you reach your turn, you recover 1d6 HP, which can recover the life loss comparable to serious injuries within 1 hour.
  2. A critical blow to your heart by others gets extra damage. The critical blow to the heart is regarded as a blow to the internal organs, and at the same time, it gets the same bonus as the blow to the head.
     - In role-play, the description of the critical attack must clearly hit the heart, not just “internal organs.”

- **Pierced heart effects:**
  1. The regeneration effect is halved (rounded down), and you continue to lose 1 casting/attack/moving action, or 2 swift actions, until you recover HP equal to or exceeding the amount of HP lost in the heart attack.
     - Example: A vital blow to the heart causes 20 damage; you must restore 20 HP to eliminate the negative effect of being pierced through the heart.
  2. If you suffer holy damage and the accumulated holy damage exceeds 20 points, the regeneration effect is also halved. If the heart is not pierced, the action-loss effect does not apply. This continues until your restored HP equals or exceeds the accumulated holy damage you have received.

- **Special:** This allows you to survive even if your head is twisted 180 degrees, as long as the head is not uprooted; you will not be considered moribund for anything other than “moribund due to lack of health state” (0 HP).
  - Even so, you suffer 1/1d2 [[Sanity]] loss each time this forced dying effect occurs.

- **Sequence scaling:**
  - **Sequence 4:** Restore hit points increases to 2d6.

### Lunar Spells

- You have mastered the spells of the [[Lunar Realm]].

#### Golem Transformation

- **Use:** You transform a creature into your [[Familia]], similar to **First Embrace**. [[First Embrace]]
- **Action:** 1 full-round action.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 willing/helpless creature.
- **Effect:** You bite off one of its veins, transforming it into a golem.

- **Becoming a blood servant** gains the following advantages/disadvantages:
  1. Strength +1, Constitution +1, Dexterity +1; will not change appearance, but pupils become red; creature type is regarded as a dark creature; gain 5 points of poison resistance; you will rarely get sick again.
  2. If terminally ill, roll 1d2:
     - 1: Your terminal illness disappears.
     - 2: Your terminal illness is treated as a serious illness.
     - This is a simple calculation; in theory, whether it disappears directly depends on the specific form of the terminal illness.
  3. You become the slave of the transformer; they are your master. You cannot disobey any order of the master, equivalent to becoming a puppet. This belongs to a curse effect; because it changes your life form, lifting the curse often means death.
  4. You can also start drinking blood instead of normal food, but you can still eat normal food.

#### First Embrace

- **Use:** You give a creature [[Extraordinary Traits]], making it a member of the [[Pack]].
- **Duration:** For at least 1 hour.
- **Requirements:** In a safe environment, choose a willing/helpless creature that comes into contact with you.
- **Effect:** You give the target a **Sequence 7** Moon Path Extraordinary Feature; you need to take this feature yourself first:

  1. After completion, the target is immediately regarded as a **Beyonder** of Moon **Sequence 7**, even if it is an ordinary person. A creature that has become a **Beyonder** of other paths can skip a promotion check with a successful identification.  
  2. Unlike the blood servant, the embraced creature will not suffer any enslavement effect, will not be regarded as a puppet, and has its own free will. Generally speaking, it is considered to have established a blood relationship with you, and it should call you brother/sister, etc.
  3. Under normal circumstances, the target who enjoys this benefit should be divorced from human society. Changing the name and surname, especially the surname, is regarded as joining your family, but this is only a social style. GM decides the meaning of the trailing “Object responsible” fragment.

> **Lore:** During the [[Quaternary Epoch]], blood races had extensive friendships with humans, which led to the generation of [[Half Blood Race]]: ordinary humans with red eyes and other characteristics but no extraordinary abilities. Some families of this kind of humans are still connected with blood races, and perhaps they can get First Embrace.

### Dark Spells

- You master a variety of dark spells, including but not limited to the following:

#### Wings of Darkness

- **Cost:** 2 Spirit points.
- **Use:** As a swift action, you create illusory bat wings.
- **Duration:** 5 minutes.
- **Effect:** A thick black mist spreads behind you, shaped like a bat’s wings.

  1. Your Agility +2 affects physical defense and mobility; within 5 minutes, you can fly in the air at a speed equal to your mobility.
  2. After 5 minutes, you will need to cast this ability again to fly again, which means you should land first.
  3. You can start making vampire bats with the help of Darkwing.

- **Sequence scaling:** For every **Sequence** increase, the duration increases by 5 minutes; demigods are not counted.
- **Special:** The dark wing has good electrical conductivity. If in the dark wing state, the Constitution test for resisting paralysis has -2 disadvantage.

##### Make Bats (Vampire Bats)

- **Action:** 1 casting action.
- **Cost:** Consume 3 spirituality points.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 or more targets.
- **Check:** Mysticism against physical defense.
- **Effect:** Create palm-sized illusory bats; this ability has the following usages:

  1. **Designate 1 target:** 3d6 curse damage; illusory bats flock to the target in groups, wrapping it inside.
  2. **Designate multiple targets:** You can designate multiple targets, but the damage needs to be shared equally. The minimum damage for a single target is 1d6. If you have more damage dice, you can also choose the first target for 2d6 damage, and the remaining targets for 1d6 damage.
     - When selecting multiple targets, you need to use the result of one occult identification to resist the physical defense of all targets at the same time. It can also be divided into three identifications at most, but you need to decide which targets and how much damage one identification represents. No matter how many checks are made, this counts as only 1 attack.

#### Shackles of the Abyss

- **Effect:** Darkness or shadows condense into illusory shackles, making the shadows come alive suddenly, restricting or controlling the enemy.
- **Action:** 1 casting action.
- **Cost:** Consume 3 spirituality points.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within line of sight.
- **Check:** Mysticism resists physical defense; ignores armor.
- **Requirements:** Shackles of the Abyss can only be used when there is darkness/shadow on the field.
- **Effect (on success):** If the identification is successful, the target is regarded as bound, bound in place by black iron chains.

  1. Enemies bound by Shackles of the Abyss cannot perform movement/attack actions; their mouths are sealed so they cannot perform language actions.
  2. Every time it is the target’s turn, it can try to break free with a Strength test of Difficulty Value 15.

#### Claws of Corrosion

- **Effect:** You let your nails grow an extra section with mysterious symbols and patterns, sharp enough to cut through steel.
- **Action:** 1 swift action.
- **Cost:** Expending 2 Spirit points.
- **Duration:** Lasts 5 minutes.
- **Weapon:** Treated as a weapon; melee deals 1d6 + Strength damage bonus curse damage, and gains the following effects:

  1. Claws of Corrosion ignore armor and damage reduction from flesh/skin, excluding curse resistance.
  2. If a target has Curse Resistance, Claws of Corrosion can ignore all physical armor defense and damage reduction except Curse Resistance.

- More logical dark spells allowed by the host; you can write the corresponding content yourself.

- **Sequence scaling:**
  - **Sequence 5:** Your dark magic is greatly enhanced.
    - **Shackles of the Abyss:** Increase the Difficulty Value of the Strength test to 20.
    - **Claws of Corrosion:** Deals 2d6 + Strength damage bonus curse damage.
    - Improvements to other custom dark spells.
  - **Sequence 4:** Your dark magic is greatly enhanced.
    - **Shackles of the Abyss:** Increase the Difficulty Value of the Strength test to 25.
    - **Claws of Corrosion:** Deals 3d6 + Strength damage bonus curse damage.
    - Improvements to other custom dark spells.

## Artificial Vampires

> **GM Note:** The following content is mixed with unofficial inferences, but the apparent differences between artificial vampires and blood races are reflected in the original work.
>
> 1. There are differences in appearance between artificial vampires and pure vampires. Pure vampires are born extraordinary; they have the characteristics of **Sequence 7** from birth, and their appearance will grow closer to “vampires” in all aspects.
> 2. Artificial vampires are essentially the main ingredients of potions obtained by people who have grown up as humans for many years by hunting vampires.
>    - Since **Sequence 7**, all moon characteristics are basically monopolized by blood races, and the main ingredients of potions cannot be obtained from other places. Even blood races usually can only wait for the death of the elders before queuing for promotion, and they may not necessarily be ranked first.
> 3. Therefore, as a human being, the artificial vampire who has grown up for many years, after becoming a **Sequence 7**, still cannot completely change the original human characteristics.
> 4. The pupils of artificial vampires are usually not completely red, but mixed with the original pupil color, and the ears and other features are not as sharp as those of the vampires. If you carefully identify them, you can easily see the difference.
>
> The target who is First Embraced by the pure blood clan usually does not have this kind of problem, or can follow the **summoner**’s wishes. Humans who join the blood clan through First Embrace are usually recognized by the blood clan.
