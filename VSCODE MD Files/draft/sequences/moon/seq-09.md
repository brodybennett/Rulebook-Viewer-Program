# Moon Pathway: Sequence 9

## Pharmacist

> **Lore:** Another negative Pathway corresponds to the [[Tarot - Moon]]. Its [[Uniqueness]] manifests as a crimson moon.

- Skilled at preparing potions; domesticating and using plants and certain parts of deceased animals to treat people.
- Strong resistance to toxins.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:** Horn of adult Pegasus; venom crystal of crown jellyfish (3 grams).

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +2.
- You can start to learn chemistry/pharmaceutical knowledge better.

### Chemistry and Pharmacy Learning

1. You can better master skills related to chemistry and pharmacy. If you accept a non-repetitive, effective, related course of at least 2 hours, your corresponding skills increase by 1 level.
2. From training to proficiency, to advanced level, you need to learn 2 and 3 times respectively. The potion at the 9th level of the Sequence can only support you to reach the advanced level for the time being; after that, the learning rate will not be able to obtain a substantial improvement.
3. You gain **Poison Resistance** 5, and you are more resistant to poison.

- Learning can only be done once a day.
- Characters who create higher Sequences can use twice the Inspiration brought by potions to improve their growth skills. [[UNCLEAR: “create higher Sequences” and “growth skills” are not defined here.]]

### Pharmacy Preparation

> **Lore:** With your accurate and effective knowledge of pharmacy and chemistry, you can help the world with medicine and heal people with medicine.

- **Time:** 1d3 hours.
- **Check:** Pharmacy or chemistry skill identification, Difficulty 20.
- **Cost:** Use enough materials to concoct the potion.

- **Potion Capacity (by [[Reputation]]):**
  - Multiply your reputation level by 10 (not the reputation value). The final result equals the total number of potions you can concoct.
  - Example: Trained = 10 bottles; proficient = 20 bottles; advanced = 30 bottles.
- Whenever the total number of potions is exhausted for the first time in the mod, roll 1d7 to determine how many days until the medicinal material supplier you cooperate with arrives to replenish the amount of potions you can deploy; subsequent replenishment time is fixed every 7 days. [[UNCLEAR: “mod” is not defined here (e.g., module/adventure).]]
- If your reputation is mastered, the total number of potions you can craft can be negligible. [[UNCLEAR: “negligible” is not mechanically precise (does this remove the limit?).]]
- If you are wanted, have no way to establish a supply channel for medicinal materials, or leave your long-term settlement (without negotiating a new supplier), medicinal materials will not be able to circulate in a normal form.
- If you don’t have time to wait for the source of goods, you can go to the local market to obtain medicinal materials:
  - The total amount of medicinal materials you can obtain immediately equals 5 × your [[Credit]] value.
  - You can choose to burn the credit level to expand the total amount of medicinal materials you can obtain immediately. Each time you lower your credit level, you can overdraw to obtain 10 more medicinal materials.
  - The temporarily reduced credit level affects your credit appraisal until funds are replenished; only then can it be restored. [[UNCLEAR: “credit appraisal” is not defined here.]]

### Drinking a Potion

- **Action:** Drinking a potion is a [[Move Action]], or **2** [[Swift Action]]s.

### Pharmaceutical Agents

> **GM Note:** The following potions can only be made using Pharmacy as a skill identification.

1. **Healing secret medicine:** A medicine used to treat diseases and exorcise evil diseases.
   - Taking the Healing Elixir will immediately make the poison or plague effect disappear, but it does not completely cure it.
   - Mild cases are cured after 6 hours.
   - Moderate cases need 2 courses of treatment.
   - Severe cases need 3 courses of treatment.
   - Each course of treatment should be separated by at least 12 hours; otherwise the toxin or disease effect will recur after a week.
   - However, a single medicinal material can already make the poison or disease effect be considered as gone, and will no longer cause effective effects.
   - If the source of the poison or disease is one higher than the medicine maker:
     - The required course of treatment is doubled.
     - The potion can only halve the effect of the poison or disease.
     - It is not considered to have disappeared until half of the course of treatment is completed.
   - Terminal illnesses that have developed to the terminal stage: only symptoms can be relieved; they cannot be really treated.
   > **Lore:** “Healing secret medicine” is a general term. Different diseases require different medicines and materials, so it usually cannot be made in advance; the right medicine can only be prescribed immediately after confirming the cause of the lesion. The form can be quite “evil” (e.g., cockroach shells, chicken blood), and may look dark green/black or smell/taste terrible.
2. **Healing Potion:**
   - Can be stored in advance.
   - Restore 2d6 [[HP]].
   - Promote rapid healing of wounds.
   - Can be taken orally or sprinkled on the wound.
3. **Analgesic essential oil:**
   - If you smell it: physical identification that does not affect death/blood volume loss can be replaced by will, and +2 is beneficial.
   - If applied to the corresponding part: that part will be +4 beneficial.
   - If you take it all: it will be replaced by all will +4 favorable.
   - Can also be used as a local anesthetic (applied for local anesthesia; taken internally for general anesthesia).
   - About an hour to take effect; other constitution-related will tests will usually also enjoy benefits.
   - Note: This is just analgesic; apart from allowing Extraordinary people to maintain their actions, it will not bring any positive effect on the actual damage to the body.
   - If the wound is not healed after the time is over, it will bring tearing pain to the Extraordinary, causing 0/1 [[Sanity]] loss.
   - Smelling it will not consume the potion; smearing it consumes half; taking it consumes it all.
4. **Refreshing Medicinal Wine:**
   - Takes effect only after taking it.
   - The Inspiration attribute will be temporarily +1; the spiritual value will not be affected.
   - Lasts for 5 minutes; after 5 minutes, you fall into a state of fatigue.
   - Divided into alcohol and non-alcohol versions; effect is the same.
5. **Preventive Potion:**
   - The basic value of [[Physical Defense]] +4.
   - Does not affect physical attributes.
   - Lasts for half an hour.
6. **Sleep Aid Potion:**
   - Your next sleep will definitely be a dream (ineffective for those who cannot dream).
   - When you wake up or face hypnosis and sleep abilities, the will test and will defense value -2 will be disadvantageous for one hour.
   - Special: If the user cannot restore sanity through sleep due to uncertainty madness, the sleep aid potion can restore this benefit once. [[UNCLEAR: “uncertainty madness” and what “this benefit” refers to are not defined here.]]
7. **Sedative Potion:**
   - Versions: injections and internal.
   - Injections usually require fights against a type of Extraordinary with tough skin to fight against their physical defenses.
   - Narcotics will keep the user in a semi-meditative state (see [[Special Actions]]).
   - Taking 2 will put you in a fully meditative state.
   - If you are in any emotional/crazy symptoms, you need to take 3 to fully meditate.
   - This full meditative state supports your normal actions. Excessive consumption will cause you to fall into a state of fatigue.
   - Exhausted state: You lose 1 cast/attack/move over time, or 2 swift actions.
   - [[Malevolence Perception]] can still perceive your malice, but each time malice appears, you can use your will against its inspiration to determine whether it is perceived. You must fully meditate to gain this benefit.
   - Tranquility potions give you a -1 benefit on sanity loss checks, but have no effect on promotions.
   - To the anesthetic of the same raw material, drug resistance will develop if it is used multiple times, and the amount of its constitution/2 will take effect after three subsequent injections. [[UNCLEAR: The drug-resistance rule is not clearly stated (especially “constitution/2” and timing).]]
8. **Anesthesia:**
   - After taking it: skill and attribute identification / will defense against dreaming -2 disadvantage; cannot be superimposed; lasts for 5 minutes.
   - Physical identification that does not involve death/blood loss can be replaced by will; analgesia is a type of anesthesia.
   - Two anesthesia can cause the voluntary/helpless target to lose consciousness for 5 minutes.
     - The disadvantage can be changed to -4 at most.
     - It will not cause complete loss of pain sensation.
     - Any damage can be recovered with 15 [[Will Test]]. [[UNCLEAR: “Any damage can be recovered” is vague about scope and timing.]]
   - An anesthetic drug can also achieve local anesthesia, so that the will test of part of the body to replace the constitution is successful by default.
   - Adverse effects do not affect Wisdom checks or will checks made in place of constitution.
9. **Heart-strengthening secret medicine:**
   - Only for targets in a [[Blood Bath]] or [[Dying]] state: their constitution appraisal +2.
   - Otherwise: constitution appraisal -2.
   - (Essence is the goal of dealing with heart failure. Once the constitution check is -2, every time the constitution fails, 1d6 health points will be lost.) [[UNCLEAR: When the repeated constitution checks occur is not specified here.]]
10. **Muscle relaxation secret medicine:**
   - After taking it, starting next round: the user's strength is -2; the muscles of the whole body begin to relax; the moving force is halved.
   - Note: Muscle relaxant, [[Requiem]], and analgesic essential oils taken orally in sequence can produce a complete anesthesia effect for half an hour, equivalent to complete fainting of a creature. If there is no breathing method similar to a ventilator, it will suffocate after 5 minutes and die.
   > **GM Note:** This is difficult to use for murder. To avoid chemical reactions, the three bottles of potions cannot be mixed together, so it needs to be taken/injected three times.

- Other medicines allowed and reasonable by GM.

### Chemicals

> **GM Note:** Crafting the following items can only use chemistry as a skill check.

1. **Poison bottle:**
   - Throwing skills against Physical Defense.
   - Causes 1d6 poison damage each round until the opponent uses a successful [[First Aid]] identification action to cleanse the poison.
   - Can be applied to other weapons; poison damage cannot be superimposed with any poison damage.
   - Applying it to a semi-biological weapon like the [[Talon of Corruption]] will cause you to be affected by the poison as well.
2. **Flame Explosion Bottle:**
   - Throw against Physical Defense.
   - Creates a miniature explosion; causes 1d6 fire damage and 1d6 physical damage.
3. **Corruption bottle:**
   - Throw against Physical Defense.
   - Mixed with a part of spiritual materials; causes 2d4 curse damage.
4. **Acid bottle:**
   - Throwing skills against Physical Defense.
   - On success: target's armor -2; if there is no armor, causes 1d6 poison damage.
   - Effect cannot be superimposed.
5. **Explosive gas:**
   - After throwing, the gas stored in the bottle instantly expands and fills the entire room.
   - Any actions related to fire and lightning in the room cause the gas to detonate immediately, causing 2d4 physical damage and 1d4 fire damage.
   - The gas is reddish-orange and quite visible; if the room is not sealed, it dissipates after 1 round.
   - The magician's flame jumps: if the flame that ignites and jumps is not within the range of the gas, it can still jump as usual.
   - Example: A magician can snap his fingers in a room full of gas, snap his fingers to ignite the bushes outside the room, and the flames will jump.
6. **Liquid Nitrogen Bottle:**
   - Throwing skill against Physical Defense.
   - On success: causes 2d4 cold damage.
   - If the target is a creature without cold resistance: causes muscle trembling, condensation and frost, and the next judgment will be -2 disadvantageous. [[UNCLEAR: “next judgment” is not specified (which check/roll).]]
7. **Sublimation steam:**
   - After throwing, the hot and cold liquid in the bottle expands and sublimates; warm white mist fills the whole room.
   - If the room is not sealed, sublimation steam escapes after 1 round; it is difficult to find remote targets in the steam.
   - Except for the special perception of [[Mystery Eye]] / [[Destiny]], if there is no way to confirm the location in other ways, and the [[id:alias-spirit-vision|Spirit Vision]] does not reach Sequence 7, it results in -2 for long-range attack and -4 for detection.

- Other GM permitted and reasonable chemicals.

### Drug Identification

- About 5 minutes of component research, in a place with enough pharmaceutical or chemical equipment:
  1. Poisons/explosives: chemical identification Difficulty 15 to know its approximate composition, positive effects/side effects.
  2. Drugs: pharmaceutical identification Difficulty 15 to know its general ingredients, positive effects/side effects.
- Formula:
  - 10 minutes of component research; Difficulty 20 corresponding identification to know the components of the drug and how to configure it.
  - If special spiritual materials are involved: even if you know the formula, you need to obtain the corresponding materials before you can configure them.
  - For every material involved in a drug that is 1 higher than yours, the corresponding identification difficulty is +10. [[UNCLEAR: “1 higher than yours” is not defined here (e.g., Sequence/grade of material).]]

### Vision (Health-Focused)

- **Activation:** 1 free action; consume 1 [[Spirituality]] per round.
- While active, your vision gains the following benefits:
  1. **Etheric body:** You can directly see through the aura field of the target where they have specific physical defects, down to a certain organ in detail. After being confirmed in this way, it will be beneficial for you to identify +2 when you specially prepare medicines for their diseases.
     - (But even if you can determine the cause/disease and prescribe the right medicine, you still don’t know exactly where they got sick.)
     - Example: You can't tell if a person's illness is simply due to bad behavior or if it's a witch's disease.
  2. **Spiritual body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature is spiritual; this cannot identify extraordinary people.
  3. **Mental body:** You can confirm whether a creature is thinking, but you cannot obtain more detailed information.
  4. **Astral body:** You cannot see the astral body.
- Notes:
  - Dead creatures are usually only dull in color and cannot be identified.
  - Spiritual materials usually have spirituality; the color of the material in the spiritual vision usually represents its corresponding Pathway. This does not mean that you can see the power of a Beyonder.
  - The color seen by the Spirit Vision allows you to see each other in the dark, but you can only see the existence of color, and it is still possible to get lost in the dark.
  - Unlike dead creatures, undead creatures have deep black spirituality color instead of none.
  - Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default, which have not been dissipated for 1 day, and cannot be recorded or stolen.

### Eco-Friendliness

- In general, potentially poisonous plants or dead animal parts will not harm you.
- If you can, you are eligible to try to domesticate some plants that can be domesticated.
- Through the identification of pharmacy/chemistry/biology with Difficulty 20, you can find a certain part of the plant or animal you need.
- Each time you successfully make this identification, you are considered to have added 1 medicinal material, which can make 1 potion.
- This ability is generally not available in cities, because the animals or plants in cities usually do not meet the special requirements for pharmaceuticals.
- This is an explanation and cannot be recorded or stolen.
