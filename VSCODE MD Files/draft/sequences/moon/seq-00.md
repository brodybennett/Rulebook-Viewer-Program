# Sequence 0: Moon

## Moon

> **Lore:** Said to be the ancestor of the blood race.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Divine Gaze
- **Use:** When any creature recites your **True Name**.
- **Effect:** You can gaze at the surroundings of that creature, and use your extraordinary abilities to target the area at will.


- **Targeting and range:** The area around the creature you are gazing through; you may use your extraordinary abilities to target that area at will.

### Mother of All Spirits

- **Use:** While your gaze is upon your chosen target; especially while a **Full Moon** is present.
- **Effect:** The **Spirit cost** of your chosen target no longer applies while under your gaze.

### Unique Red Moon

- **Cost:** One thought.
- **Effect:** You can use the moon to cover up the sun’s brilliance, making it a **Red Moon** or **Blood Moon** 24 hours a day, or even forever.
- **Aftereffects:** The negative power can ravage the earth, allowing the **Spirit World** to interact with reality for a long time, releasing countless unspeakable monsters and evil spirits. This is a world-scale regional effect defined by the GM.
- **Additional effect:** At the same time, you can also turn the red moon into **Bright Moonlight**.
- **Limits:** A **White Moon** will not have any mystic effects, equivalent to a “dispelled moonlight block.” [[Moonlight Block]]
