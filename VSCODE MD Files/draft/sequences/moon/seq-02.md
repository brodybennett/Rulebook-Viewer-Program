# Blood Duke Pathway: Sequence 2

## Life-Giver

> **Lore:** You master the “power of creation,” making the life around you feel the joy of growth and the arrival of new life.

- See also: [[Blood Duke Pathway]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Bring new life to a destroyed site or barren land; at the full moon, make spirit creatures active again; make wild animals or intelligent creatures willing to come here to reproduce and pass on from generation to generation; make this place re-possess the prerequisites and foundations that can become a civilization.

> **GM Note:** The source labels this as an “unofficial ceremony.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +2; your **Pharmacy**, **Chemistry**, and **Biology** skills increase by one level each.

### Creation Authority

Creation of all things; creation of life; fundamentally possesses the power of incarnation and “creation.”

- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality**
- **Use:** **Casting action**
- **Effect:** On the basis of having seen or understood creatures, you can improve, create, or even create a unique species out of thin air.
- **Limits:** Requires a successful corresponding **Science test**.

### Life

You can speed up the metabolism and recovery speed of creatures, and give all living beings the extraordinary resilience of blood races.

- **Cost:** 15 **Spirituality** points
- **Use:** Single **Casting action**
- **Effect:** Bring anyone who is not completely dead back to life, allowing their damaged body and even their soul to instantly restore and grow life.
- **Limits:** Limited to two uses per encounter.
- **Aftereffects / Additional Effects:**
  - Removes any presence of curses, toxins, and diseases.
  - Insanity is terminated immediately, and all **Sanity** points lost due to insanity are restored.
  - Cannot reverse loss of control; for loss of control and extraordinary creatures, this only allows them to continue to have part reason.

### Additional

- **Cost:** 8 points of **Spirituality**
- **Use:** **Casting action**
- **Targeting and range:** All dead objects within your line of sight
- **Effect:**
  - You can animate all dead objects within your line of sight, including extraordinary items.
  - You can make undead creatures have part of their essence, which is judged as an ordinary existence.
- **Limits:**
  - If the target is a slave of the God of Death Pathway, it can still dominate these former undead creatures.
  - Undead creatures transformed into ordinary existence no longer enjoy physical immunity and can be hit by vital points.
- **Additional Effects:**
  - Allied members who are cast by you at the same time can enjoy your life regeneration effect every round together, but they will not have your **Heart Weakness**.
  - The ferryman of the death path will lose the direct-looking death effect in the round you use this, and it lasts until your next round of action under normal circumstances.
    - The ferryman retains the life drain of each round.
    - Maintaining this means you need to continue to pay **Spirituality**.
    - Suppression of undead creatures is incidental.
  - Full activation of an undead creature is limited to creatures less than a demigod in a round; creatures above a demigod follow the times below. GM decides how “life grants” map to full activation uses.

- **Life grants by target Sequence (for creatures above a demigod):**
  - **Sequence 4:** Three life grants; temporary transformation into normal creatures.
  - **Sequence 3:** Five life grants; temporary transformation into normal creatures (excluding ferrymen who have completely become dead).

- **Undead transformation constraints:**
  - An undead creature of the same tier as you cannot transform unless it volunteers and you are given enough time.
  - The life grant to an undead creature wears off over time.
  - This is not really equivalent to resurrection. To turn back to the living in this way:
    - You need to repair the deformed state of the spirit body so that it looks more biological when alive.
    - There will be memory loss after resurrection.
    - It will turn back into an undead creature after one year, and completely dissipate due to exhaustion of **Spirituality**.
  - People who have been dead for many years are usually unable to do this.
  - If the target is a soulless skeleton or zombie, it cannot be resurrected into a real original person.

- **Promotion:**
  - If you have promoted to **Sequence** 1, the number of life grants required is -1.
  - **Sequence** 0 is excluded.

### Bottom-Level Improvement

You can make incredible modifications to creatures, and this modification will be directly engraved into the genetic information inside the gene.

- **Cost:** 3 **Spirituality** points
- **Use:** Free action
- **Effect:** Make a **Biology check** and apply the outcome below.

- **Outcome:**
  - **Big Fail:** Instantly randomly spawns a horrible monster.
  - **Difficulty Value 10:** You can swap the limbs of two creatures, or swap a certain trait (e.g., make a human grow fish gills).
  - **Difficulty Value 15:** You can cause a creature to grow an extra limb like a normal creature’s, at a rate of one limb for every 5 points above **Difficulty Value 15**.
    - Using an additional physical attack always requires a new special fighting skill; otherwise it is considered untrained.
  - **Difficulty Value 20:** You give a creature a trait that cannot exist in nature, and that trait lasts forever.
  - **Difficulty Value 25:** Even more incredible transformations.
  - **Difficulty Value 30:** Beyond the scope of transformation itself, the opponent is directly regarded as a new life that retains its own consciousness.
  - **Big hit:** A makeover that almost perfectly fulfills your wishes.
