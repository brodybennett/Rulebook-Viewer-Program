### Magic Potion

> **GM Note:** The RAW notes that simple gatherings of Beyonders cannot fully afford the Potions Professor’s Beyonder materials, and suggests suppliers typically come from within the blood clan; if contact with the blood clan is broken (or the Potions Professor does not belong to the blood clan), they must establish cooperation with another Extraordinary force (often via an organization or an Extraordinary party host, usually not personal).

#### Magic Potion Shelf Life

- **Effect:** A magic potion has a shelf life equivalent to the results of Pharmaceutical or Chemical identification when making the medicine.
- **Effect:** A final identification value of 24 means the potion can last for 24 days without expiration. Identification
- **Aftereffects:** If the shelf life is exceeded, the magic potion is barely effective for one day, but the effect is only half; after that one day, it is completely ineffective.
- **Limits:** When using life-sucking to create additional magic potions, the storage time and effect of such magic potions are only 5 minutes, and the medicinal materials need to be consumed. [[Life-Sucking]]
- **Use:** This requires passing a Difficulty Value 20 Chemical (Poison or Explosives) or Pharmacological (Drugs) identification. [[Chemical (Poison or Explosives)]] [[Pharmacological (Drugs)]] Difficulty Value
