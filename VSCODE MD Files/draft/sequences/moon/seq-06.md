# Blood Baron Pathway: Sequence 6

## Potions Professor

> **Lore:** Able to obtain magical buff effects by drinking a concocted potion.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
- Chemistry and Pharmacy can be quickly upgraded to Erudition. [[LINK LATER: Erudition | type=term | hint=skill tier/category]]

### Magic Potion

- **Effect:** You can configure powerful magic potions. Depending on the type, a magic potion may show characteristics such as boiling, wriggling, dark, or off-white.
- **Limits:** Magic potions usually require a separate extraordinary medicinal material. [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Medicinal Materials | type=term | hint=crafting reagents economy]]
- **Limits:** The number of magic potions a Potions Professor can make is three times the reputation level. [[LINK LATER: Reputation Level | type=mechanic | hint=character status/renown]]
- **Limits:** The circulation mechanism of extraordinary medicinal materials is the same as that of Sequence 9 Pharmacists. [[LINK LATER: Pharmacists | type=sequence | hint=Sequence 9]]
- **Limits:** To obtain a continuous supply of extraordinary medicinal materials, the Potions Professor must establish a friendly relationship with a stable extraordinary force organization and establish supply cooperation. [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Force Organization | type=faction | hint=supply partner for reagents]]
- **Limits:** The Potions Professor must establish such a connection for circulating supply to take effect; otherwise, the Potions Professor cannot obtain the supply of extraordinary medicinal materials and can only search for medicinal materials manually or purchase them immediately.
- **Limits:** The number of extraordinary medicinal materials that can be purchased immediately is equivalent to three times the reputation level, and the mechanism is consistent with that of the Sequence 9 period. [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9 period | type=sequence | hint=rules referenced for purchasing]]
- **Limits:** Immediate purchase cannot be from an ordinary market; it must be at least a black market involving the Extraordinary field or a gathering of Extraordinary people. [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Gathering | type=location | hint=black market / meetup]]

> **GM Note:** The RAW notes that simple gatherings of Beyonders cannot fully afford the Potions Professor’s Beyonder materials, and suggests suppliers typically come from within the blood clan; if contact with the blood clan is broken (or the Potions Professor does not belong to the blood clan), they must establish cooperation with another Extraordinary force (often via an organization or an Extraordinary party host, usually not personal). [[LINK LATER: Blood Clan | type=faction | hint=vampire-related group]] [[LINK LATER: Beyonder Materials | type=term | hint=advancement/crafting reagents]] [[LINK LATER: Beyonder | type=term | hint=supernatural character type]]

#### Magic Potion Shelf Life

- **Effect:** A magic potion has a shelf life equivalent to the results of Pharmaceutical or Chemical identification when making the medicine.
- **Effect:** A final identification value of 24 means the potion can last for 24 days without expiration. [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=skill check result meaning]]
- **Aftereffects:** If the shelf life is exceeded, the magic potion is barely effective for one day, but the effect is only half; after that one day, it is completely ineffective.
- **Limits:** When using life-sucking to create additional magic potions, the storage time and effect of such magic potions are only 5 minutes, and the medicinal materials need to be consumed. [[LINK LATER: Life-Sucking | type=mechanic | hint=creating extra potions]]
- **Use:** This requires passing a Difficulty Value 20 Chemical (Poison or Explosives) or Pharmacological (Drugs) identification. [[LINK LATER: Chemical (Poison or Explosives) | type=term | hint=skill/specialization]] [[LINK LATER: Pharmacological (Drugs) | type=term | hint=skill/specialization]] [[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=term | hint=check threshold]]

## Regular Potions

- **Note:** There may be conflicts between different types of potions that bring bad effects, so you need to try to control the type and quantity of potions you take each time.
- **Limit:** The number of magic potions that are effective at the same time cannot exceed your physical fitness value. [[LINK LATER: Physical Fitness Value | type=mechanic | hint=cap on concurrent potion effects]]

1. **Strength Potion**
   - **Effect:** Strength +2.
   - **Duration:** 1 hour.
   - **Limits:** Can only be taken once every 12 hours.

2. **Agility Potion**
   - **Effect:** Agility +2.
   - **Duration:** 1 hour.
   - **Limits:** Can only be taken once every 12 hours.

3. **Charming Potion**

   - **Duration:** 1 hour.
   - **Limits:** Can only be taken once every 12 hours.

4. **Defense Elixir**
   - **Effect:** Gain 4 points of armor.
   - **Duration:** 1 hour.
   - **Limits:** This effect cannot be superimposed with other armor. [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat / stacking rules]]

5. **Potion of Destruction**
   - **Use:** Throw it against physical defenses.
   - **Effect:** Produces a large amount of black flames, causing 2d6 curses, 2d6 poisons, and 2d6 fire damage to an area with a radius of 3 meters. [[LINK LATER: Curse Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] [[LINK LATER: Poison Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] [[LINK LATER: Fire Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]]
   - **Targeting and range:** Area, radius 3 meters.
   - **Effect:** If you drink it directly, the damage is doubled.

6. **Fire Dragon’s Breath**
   - **Use:** After drinking the potion, one quick action, only once, can’t be superimposed. [[LINK LATER: Quick Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]
   - **Effect:** You can spew out a hot wave of red flames from your mouth; Mysticism against physical defense, success will cause 4d6 flames to 1 target harm. [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=mechanic | hint=attack/skill type]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]]
   - **Aftereffects:** After taking the dragon’s breath, the user will not be able to speak until the flame is released.

7. **Invisibility Potion**
   - **Effect:** You are immediately considered invisible, but only your body is invisible; your clothes and carrying items will not be invisible. [[LINK LATER: Invisible | type=condition | hint=visibility rules]]

8. **Stealth Spray**
   - **Effect:** The place where it is sprayed will become invisible.
   - **Use:** Generally, this needs to be combined with the Stealth Potion: first drink the Stealth Potion, then use the spray to make yourself invisible. [[UNCLEAR: “Stealth Potion” is referenced but not listed elsewhere in this section; it may refer to the Invisibility Potion or another potion.]]
   - **Limits:** The spray and perfume can be sprayed three times.
   - **Effect:** Not using the spray directly is explained as: under the cover of clothes, some dead corners of the body may not be completely invisible with a simple spray, and the eyes may also need to be sprayed.

9. **Odorless Perfume**
   - **Use:** Spray or sprinkle all over the body.
   - **Effect:** Causes an area or a creature to not produce any smell; identification related to smell will automatically fail. [[LINK LATER: Smell-Based Identification | type=mechanic | hint=automatic failure rule]]

10. **Healing Potion**
   - **Effect:** Eliminates all toxins and diseases. [[LINK LATER: Toxins | type=condition | hint=poison/disease status]] [[LINK LATER: Diseases | type=condition | hint=illness status]]
   - It takes two courses of treatment to be higher than the drug maker. [[UNCLEAR: “higher than the drug maker” is unclear without the referenced comparison rules.]]
   - The first bottle can treat toxins and diseases as if they were gone.
   - Terminally ill patients only need two courses of treatment to be asymptomatic; three courses of treatment completely recovered. [[LINK LATER: Terminal Illness | type=condition | hint=rules for terminal cases]]

> **GM Note:** You can also make a list of potions for other pathways (for example, solar holy water of the Solar Pathway); see the corresponding content for details. [[LINK LATER: Solar Pathway | type=pathway | hint=other pathway]] [[LINK LATER: Solar Holy Water | type=item | hint=potion/consumable]]

> **GM Note:** Other GMs may allow additional reasonable magic potions. For more potions, refer to “Chapter 15: Special Potions, Charms, Extraordinary Items”. [[LINK LATER: Chapter 15: Special Potions, Charms, Extraordinary Items | type=table | hint=reference chapter for more potions]]
