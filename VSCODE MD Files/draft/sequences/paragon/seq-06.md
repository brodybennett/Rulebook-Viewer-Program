You create ingenious mechanical wonders with a wealth of real-world knowledge.

- **Use:** For at least 10 minutes, perform a **Difficulty Value** 25 crafting appraisal [[Crafting Appraisal]] to create a **Mechanical Wonder**.
- **Cost:** 1 **Steam Material** [[Steam Material]] per production.
- **Steam materials on hand:** You have Steam Materials equal to your **reputation rank** (not reputation rating ×5). If your reputation is **Proficient** or higher, ignore this cap. If you are a **Beyonder** of the [[Church of Steam]], treat your reputation as **Advanced** when calculating materials. [[Reputation]]
- **Repair/improvement:** Every time a Mechanical Wonder is repaired or improved, 1 Steam Material is consumed, and it will not occupy more slots.
- **Carrying limit:** You can carry at most Steam Wonders equal to your [[Strength]] value. 1 point of Strength corresponds to 1 Steam Material (1 slot). If a Mechanical Wonder uses 2 Steam Materials, it occupies 2 slots.

#### Mechanical Wonders

1. **Steam Trolley**
   - **Cost:** 1 Steam Material.
   - **Use:** 1 Casting Action to activate.
   - **Effect:** You can order it to explore an area; the car has 10 points of movement. [[Movement Points]]
   - **Limits:** Its behavior in this process is uncontrollable, and it cannot be fed back to you on the screen; if it is destroyed, you still receive partial information (general layout/last known position) but no details.
   - The shape can be customized, and it is driven by steam.

2. **Gliding Drone**
   - **Cost:** 1 Steam Material.
   - **Use:** 1 Casting Action to activate.
   - **Effect:** After activation, it will use steam as kinetic energy to climb up 10 meters, and then glide in a direction you specify at a speed of 15 movement points per round.
   - **Limits:** The drone descends 1 meter per round. Other functions are the same as the Steam Trolley, and it is also unable to control accurate behavior and feed pictures.
   - The shape can be customized.

3. **Spring Fist**
   - **Cost:** 1 Steam Material.
   - **Use:** 1 Attack Action.
   - **Targeting and range:** The spring fist can attack creatures within 5 meters of you as the center.
   - **Effect:** Creatures facing the spring fist for the first time suffer the [[Flat-Footed]] effect.
   - **Damage:** Fixed 3d6 physical damage; automatically snaps back after striking.
   - The shape can be customized.

4. **Steam Power Fist**
   - **Cost:** 2 parts of Steam Material.
   - **Damage:** A power fist can do 1d6+Strength damage dice and doesn’t stack with other weapons; you obviously can’t hit someone with a knife and a fist at the same time.
   - **Use:** 1 [[Full-Round Action]] to store power.
   - **Effect:** The steam gushing out from the back of the glove accelerates the bearer; the burst of power roars out immediately, causing an additional 2d6 physical damage. If you move with the attack, you gain **+3 Movement Points** for that action.
   - The appearance is a metal material that is a full circle larger than the fist.

5. **Metal Exoskeleton**
   - **Cost:** 2 Steam Materials.
   - **Effect:** The exoskeleton can be hidden in the wearer’s clothes.
   - **While wearing:** The wearer’s Strength and Agility (DEX) are temporarily +1.
   - **Limits:** A metal exoskeleton can only be used for a target of similar size; otherwise it needs to be customized.

6. **Hidden Hidden Blade**
   - **Cost:** 1 Steam Material.
   - **Form:** A bracelet; shape can be customized.
   - **Use:** 1 Swift Action to cause the Hidden Blade to pop out; it has the same effect as a [[Small Knife]].
   - **Special:** If you eject the Hidden Blade while making physical contact with an opponent, the Hidden Blade alone deals 1d4 damage as a Swift Action.

7. **Steam Semi-Automatic Machine Gun**
   - **Cost:** 2 parts of Steam Material.
   - **Damage:** Each bullet has 1d6 damage.
   - **Requirement:** This requires a special “[[Fire (Machine Gun)]]” skill roll.
   - **Use:** 1 Attack Action; the machine gun can fire up to 6 rounds in a row, but the chain has a full 30 rounds.
   - **Targeting:** When using a semi-automatic machine gun, use 1 [[Shot (Machine Gun)]] to identify at most three targets standing together at the same time; no matter how many bullets are fired in a row, only 1 identification is required.
   - **Damage split:** You can split the damage by yourself and choose how many bullets hit different targets.
   - **Improvement limits:** The improvement of the machine gun can only increase the final damage; it cannot increase the damage by 1d6 for each bullet, and the consumption of 6 bullets remains the same. **Optional upgrade:** increase the burst to 7 bullets; if so, it consumes 7 bullets.

   > **GM Note:** The text’s rationale for “only 1 identification” compares this to real machine guns (slow muzzle movement/aim; missing early makes later hits harder), but does not add extra mechanics beyond the rules above.

8. **External Alarm**
   - **Cost:** 1 Steam Material to make 3.
   - **Type:** Additional accessory of the above Steam Wonders.
   - **Effect:** You can set a condition; when the condition is met, the alarm will sound, which can be heard within 100 meters.
   - **Examples:** You can have a car go off when it hits a wall, and a semi-automatic machine gun go off when it fires.
   - **Limits:** This condition should conform to a mechanical logic. For example, you can’t call the police when a creature appears, unless the alarm can recognize faces; this is not the technology that should exist in this era.

9. **Jetpack**
   - **Cost:** 2 Steam Materials.
   - **Use:** 1 Casting Action to activate.
   - **Effect:** The jetpack will take you up 10 meters, or fly a short distance in a certain direction.
   - **Limits:** The jetpack can only support you to fly for 1 Movement Action , and the [[Movement Force]] +5 when flying.
   - **Recharge:** After the flight action is over, the jetpack needs to be recharged for 1 round.
   - **Safety:** You don’t have to worry about falling down because there is no energy; the jetpack will retain the steam to take you down slowly after your flight.
   - The appearance can be customized.

- Other reasonable mechanical wonders allowed by the GM.

> **GM Note:** When writing mechanical wonders, pay attention to the technological progress of the mysterious world. In the original-work timeline, the first wireless telegraph is only in its infancy. This is why the oddities above lack radio-like functionality.

You craft an **Extraordinary Item**.

- **Prerequisite:** Before using this ability, make sure the artisan **Beyonder** has read [[Chapter Eight: Extraordinary Items]] so they already know the different types of Extraordinary Items (e.g., spells, amulets, spiritual material Extraordinary Items, and Extraordinary characteristic Extraordinary Items). Although these products have different names, we collectively refer to them here as Extraordinary Items.

#### Extraordinary Characteristic Items

You create an Extraordinary Item according to the following procedure:

- **Make the body:** With a **Difficulty Value** 15 crafting identification [[Crafting Identification]] , make the shape of the item you want (a “body”). This may consume materials, but not necessarily Steam Materials; ready-made items can also be directly used as the body.
- **Integrate the characteristic:** Prepare 1 [[Extraordinary Characteristic]] and carry out a **Difficulty Value** 20 crafting identification to integrate the characteristic into the item.
  - For each Sequence level the characteristic is **lower** than yours, the difficulty is **-5**; for each Sequence level **higher**, the difficulty is **+5**. If the characteristic’s **Personality** is higher than yours, add **+10**. [[Personality]]
- **Reclamation limit:** Crafted items can only be crushed again and return to Extraordinary Characteristics only when they are subjected to [[Angel-Level Power]].

You determine the item’s extraordinary abilities as follows:

1. **Determine the ability quantity of the item**
   - Every Beyonder is generally gradually promoted from Sequence 9 to Sequence 7 or higher.
   - Example premise: If you have a copy of Extraordinary Characteristics and assume it is a copy of Sequence 7’s Extraordinary Characteristics, then there is a high probability that this Extraordinary Characteristic contains Sequence 9–8 Extraordinary Characteristics, a total of 3 copies of Extraordinary Characteristics.
   - **Ability count from characteristics:** For every Extraordinary Characteristic, this item has 1 ability (e.g., 3 characteristics → 3 abilities).
   - **Adjust by die:** Roll 1d3:
     - On a 1: add 1 ability to the existing ability total.
     - On a 2: remain unchanged.
     - On a 3: subtract 1 ability.
   - Repeated characteristics of the same **Pathway** and **Sequence** will not be counted.

2. **Choose one Extraordinary Ability**
   - You have passed manufacturing appraisals with varying degrees of difficulty when manufacturing Extraordinary Items.
   - If the identification is successful, you can choose one extraordinary ability contained in this characteristic; the finished product must have this ability.
   - If the identification fails, the extraordinary ability of this item will be completely random.
   - The attribute and skill improvement brought by the potion is also counted as a unified benefit, including both attribute improvement and skill improvement. [[Potion Improvement]]
   - If certain abilities are marked as unrecordable or stealable, then you must acquire potion stats and skill enhancements to obtain it.
   - You can get the potion improvement of a certain sequence level at most, but you cannot get the potion improvement of multiple sequence levels.
   - Every time the identification result is 5 higher than the required difficulty, the ability you can choose will increase by 1.

3. **Determine how many times you need to randomize the ability**
   - Compute: “total number of abilities of the item − number of abilities you choose.” The remaining value is how many times you will randomize next.

   **Start random ability**
   - Roll 1d“sequence level of the item.”
     - Example: a Sequence 9 characteristic has only 1 sequence level; a Sequence 7 characteristic has 3 sequence levels, so the latter needs 1d3.
   - If you roll:
     - 1: you randomly obtain a Sequence 9 ability.
     - 2: you randomly obtain a Sequence 8 ability.
     - 3: you randomly obtain a Sequence 7 ability.
   - If you roll a given Sequence (e.g., Sequence 7): check how many abilities there are in that Sequence, then roll 1d“Ability Type of that Sequence” to determine the ability you obtain.

   > **GM Note (example from RAW):** If making a Sequence 7 voyeur (wizard) feature into an Extraordinary Item, roll 1d3; on a 3, the randomized ability is a Sequence 7 ability. If the Sequence 7 abilities of the Mystery Peer include (1) attribute and skill improvement of potions, (2) high-speed divine words, (3) spellcasters (fireball, thunder, etc. belong to a subdivision of this ability), and (4) wood-making witchcraft, then roll 1d4; on a 4, you get Timber Wizardry as a random ability. Repeat for each remaining randomized ability.

   - **Special:** The strength of the living corpse, the indestructible body, and the steel skin of the heterogeneous Sequence 6 living corpse are three different individual abilities; they cannot be selected as subdivisions. The undead characteristic of the living corpse is a permanent effect of the potion.

4. **Determine negative effects**
   - Check whether the highest Sequence level of Extraordinary Characteristics is higher than that of the creator.
   - If it is higher than the creator:
     - Roll 1d2 to confirm whether it has the characteristic of being alive. On a 2, it has.
     - Roll 1d3 to determine the number of its negative effects, and determine the form of the negative effects based on the number.
       - If there is only **one** negative effect: roll another 1d3 to determine the strength of this effect:
         1. Put the user into a negative effect that may cause death, or permanently and permanently distort the personality.
         2. Carrying it for more than a certain period of time will almost certainly kill the user, or permanently distort the personality.
         3. It will implicate the death of people around the user due to unknown reasons, which occurs almost regularly and instantaneously or lasts for a period of time.
       - If there are **2–3** negative effects: instead roll 1d2 to determine the strength of these effects.
         1. It will cause the holder to suffer the negative effect of the extraordinary ability under certain conditions or at regular intervals (the range ability may be hit regardless of the enemy or the enemy).
         2. On the basis of the previous article, this negative effect will also put the holder in a dangerous situation.
   - If the highest Sequence level of Extraordinary Characteristics is equal to or lower than the creator:
     - Roll 1d2 negative effects, and then roll another 1d2 to determine the strength of these 1–2 negative effects:
       1. Negative effects that cause little actual damage (e.g., being drenched in the user’s blood after each use).
       2. Negative effects that will cause certain damage but can be dealt with (e.g., making the holder’s emotions amplified and making it easier to act emotionally).
   - **Note:** After deciding the strength of the negative effect, use the same method to randomize the manifestation of the negative effect in the same way as the previous random sequence ability.
   - If a positive and negative effect end up the same, change the negative effect to another form (example: become smarter at ordinary times, but after wearing it for a long time, become an idiot because the brain calculates too fast).

#### Main Material Extraordinary Items

On the basis of the above, replace the Extraordinary Characteristics used for manufacturing with the main material of a certain Sequence.

- The main ingredients of a potion come from Extraordinary creatures, and Extraordinary creatures are actually Extraordinary people who have eaten Extraordinary Characteristics, the only difference between humans and animals.
- Which Sequence level a main material corresponds to represents which Sequence level ability it possesses.
  - Example: if you directly use a [[Red Priest]] Sequence 5 main material to make Extraordinary Items, you can get the extraordinary ability of Red Priest 5; but unlike Extraordinary Characteristics, items made from the main material usually do not contain lower-Sequence abilities.
  - (In the same example: although this main material represents Red Priest 5, it does not contain the ability of Sequence 9–6.)
- **Judgment rule:** A main material can be directly regarded as an Extraordinary Characteristic that does not contain lower-Sequence abilities, so as to directly apply the production process of Extraordinary Characteristic Items; its benefits are naturally only regarded as having only one characteristic, initially only **1 individual ability**.
- **Special:** The main material of some Sequence levels may not be one, but two.
  - Example: the main material of Sequence 4 of the Paragon pathway has both the main eye of the trick monster and the real soul body of the predator of the spiritual world.
  - These two main materials each have half the ability of the crafty mage (e.g., one can jump with flames but the other can’t; the other can transform into a marionette and exchange positions with marionettes, while the one with flame jumps can’t do it).
  - If only half of the main materials are used, the produced items will naturally be incapacitated, or the effect will be halved.

#### Spiritual Materials, Spells, and Amulets

- For spiritual materials, Extraordinary Items, spells, and amulets, refer to [[Chapter Eight: Extraordinary Items]] and [[Common Ritual Magic]].
- The levels of Extraordinary Items with [[Spiritual Materials]] are unified as:
  - Sequence 9 (low-Sequence materials)
  - Sequence 8 (medium-Sequence materials)
  - Sequence 7 (high-Sequence materials)
- This kind of item can use the ability of the medium and high Sequence, but the strength needs to be reduced to the low Sequence (e.g., reduce the damage by one-third, or split a complete effect into three times, and only trigger a part each time).

- **Effect:** Extraordinary Crafting resolves using its yaml ability block and section prose.
- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
