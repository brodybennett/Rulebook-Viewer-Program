> **Lore:** Anciently known as "The Demon of Mystery".

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Intuition (INT)** +2; **Education** +1; **Occultism** +1 level.
- Choose two **Education**-related skills; each increases by 1 level.

### Reconstruction of Phenomena

> **Lore:** "We don't need mystery, the material law of this world is the greatest mystery."

- **Cost:** 5 points of **Spirituality**.
- **Use:** A Casting Action.
- **Effect:** You reproduce a real phenomenon and explain its mystery. The following **Astronomical** phenomena are available:
  - **Transit:** The sun or moon is obscured in the sky, and a **100-meter radius** area centered on you is covered by sudden shadows. From everyone's point of view, there seems to be a huge black shadow in the entire sky; its outline seems to be a planet or a star that covers the sun or moon and covers this area.
  - **Roche Limit:**
    - **Targeting and range:** Choose a target within 5 meters of you.
    - **Resolution:** **Astronomical** against the target’s **Physical Defense**.
    - **Effect (on success):** Your body produces a strong gravitational force that drags the target directly to your side; during the process the target is torn by gravity and takes 3d6 + **Strength** damage die. Treat your **Intuition (INT)** as **Strength** for this damage.
  - **Theia:** When you deal damage through physical contact, you restore **Vitality** equal to half of the damage dealt.
