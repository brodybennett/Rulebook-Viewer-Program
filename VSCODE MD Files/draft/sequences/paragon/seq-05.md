# Paragon Pathway: **Sequence** 5: Astronomer

> **Lore:** Known as “star magician” (“star warlock”) in ancient times; it can guide the power of stars to bless itself.


## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Based on the exact astronomical phenomena that have occurred, establish a physical model that is scaled down in equal proportions, including:
  - the distance between the stars,
  - the specific process of the astronomical phenomenon,
  - the duration of the maintenance.
- Taking the potion (unofficial ritual) at the end of the above model ritual.

### Promotion Effect

- **Effect:** The moment you are promoted to an Astronomer, your spirit will be thrown into all the astronomical phenomena that the Extraordinary has witnessed in their entire life, entering an illusion and falling into an ocean of unreal astronomical phenomena.
- These naturally occurring astronomical phenomena do not belong to the Extraordinary. You cannot fully understand the logic and specific composition of these phenomena, so you cannot distinguish between reality and illusion in hallucinations, and use rigorous dialectical logic to find the anchor point of reality.
- The astronomical phenomenon reproduced through the physical model is also a kind of astronomical phenomenon that extraordinary people have witnessed. With the help of this scale model that can fully understand the principle, process, and duration, Astronomers can distinguish in hallucinations that have been understood and practiced a model of astronomical phenomena, discovering its difference from other astronomical phenomena, so as to find the real anchor, stabilize the self, and complete the promotion.

> **Lore:** Astronomers and astrologers in the [[Secret Voyeurs Pathway]] are similar in purpose. When promoted, they use false knowledge to avoid risks, but one is to imitate falsehood through practice, and the other is to create falsehood through knowledge theory.
