# **Sequence** 5: Astronomer

> **Lore:** Known as “star magician” (“star warlock”) in ancient times; it can guide the power of stars to bless itself.

[[UNCLEAR: The RAW does not state which **Pathway** this Sequence belongs to; the standard Sequence heading format requires a Pathway name.]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Based on the exact astronomical phenomena that have occurred, establish a physical model that is scaled down in equal proportions, including:
  - the distance between the stars,
  - the specific process of the astronomical phenomenon,
  - the duration of the maintenance.
- Taking the potion (unofficial ritual) at the end of [[UNCLEAR: Sentence is cut off in RAW; the ritual’s final step is incomplete.]]

### Promotion Effect

- **Effect:** The moment you are promoted to an Astronomer, your spirit will be thrown into all the astronomical phenomena that the Extraordinary has witnessed in their entire life, entering an illusion and falling into an ocean of unreal astronomical phenomena.
- These naturally occurring astronomical phenomena do not belong to the Extraordinary. You cannot fully understand the logic and specific composition of these phenomena, so you cannot distinguish between reality and illusion in hallucinations, and use rigorous dialectical logic to find the anchor point of reality.
- The astronomical phenomenon reproduced through the physical model is also a kind of astronomical phenomenon that extraordinary people have witnessed. With the help of this scale model that can fully understand the principle, process, and duration, Astronomers can distinguish in hallucinations that have been understood and practiced a model of astronomical phenomena, discovering its difference from other astronomical phenomena, so as to find the real anchor, stabilize the self, and complete the promotion.

> **Lore:** Astronomers and astrologers in the [[LINK LATER: Secret Voyeurs Pathway | type=pathway | hint=mentioned as “path of secret voyeurs”]] are similar in purpose. When promoted, they use false knowledge to avoid risks, but one is to imitate falsehood through practice, and the other is to create falsehood through knowledge theory.

  - [[UNCLEAR: “rd24” is not defined; RAW does not specify what die/mechanic “rd24” represents.]]

  - **Moon (Goddess of the Night):** During the effective period, your strength, constitution, and agility +1, and you can temporarily enter a state where you can maintain your spirit without sleep.
- (When the first celestial phenomenon effect ends, you can perform another rd24 to determine the next celestial phenomenon time, but 1d7 is no longer needed, and the next celestial phenomenon effect will be directly cycled in order from small to large, until all cycles are 1 time)
  - [[UNCLEAR: “rd24” is undefined, and “cycled in order from small to large” lacks a defined ordering list in RAW.]]
- **Special:** After the God of War timeline, the effect of the God of War will be invalid and changed to 1d6, but the Goddess of the Night is still valid, but the moon is changed to stars.
  - [[UNCLEAR: “God of War timeline,” “changed to 1d6,” and “moon is changed to stars” are not fully defined in RAW.]]
