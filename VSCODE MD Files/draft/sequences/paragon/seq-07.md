# Sequence 7: Appraiser

You can quickly identify magical items, intuitively grasp the abilities and problems of most supernatural items, and avoid hidden dangers to the greatest extent when using them.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Intuition (INT) +2.
- Your Mysticism follows Sequence 9 rapid growth rules; cap at **Master**; growth count increases sequentially (2/3/4).

### Spiritual Identification

You judge the type and function of a thing or item.

- **Use:** As a **Swift Action**, choose an item you’re holding and make a **Difficulty Value (Difficulty Value)** 15 Occult check.
- **Cost:** If the target is an extraordinary item or extraordinary material, consume 2 points of **spirituality**.
- **Effect:** On use, you can attempt one of the following identifications (as applicable):

1. **Identify extraordinary items:** You immediately know the abilities and negative effects of this extraordinary item.
   - You also learn the item’s specific form, such as:
     - a charm,
     - an amulet,
     - an extraordinary item made of spiritual materials, or
     - an extraordinary item made of extraordinary characteristics.
   - If it is one of the first three forms, you can identify the specific remaining effective time.
   - For the difference between these extraordinary items, refer to [[Chapter Eight: Extraordinary Items]].
   - **Special:** For extraordinary items **one size category larger than you**, you can only get 1d2 items of information at most. You can use 1 hour of identification to get up to 2d3 items of information; the latter overlaps with the former.

2. **Identification of extraordinary materials:** You immediately know the **Pathway**, purpose, and name of the extraordinary materials, or whether they are the main and auxiliary materials of the potion.

3. **Identification of conventional items:** You immediately know the function of this item, whether it is advanced enough, whether there is room for improvement, and whether its maker is crappy, a beginner, or excellent.
   - This can also tell whether a normal item is a counterfeit.
   - It is generally difficult for an extraordinary item to be identified as a counterfeit unless clues are obtained.

### Spiritual Sense

You can detect whether an object within your field of vision is spiritual, or whether the object has a defect.

- **Effect:** You are more sensitive to extraordinary items. You can directly:
  - see whether an item has spirituality, then judge whether it belongs to extraordinary items; or
  - see whether an item has defects, including whether it has a delicate and complex structure.
- **Special:** When you witness an extraordinary material/characteristic/item, you can directly determine the **Pathway** it belongs to, provided that you already know the existence of this Pathway.
  - Example: you can tell which material belongs to the [[Red Priest]] only after you know the Pathway of the Red Priest.
- **Limits:** This can only give the most basic information above. To obtain detailed information, you must use **Spiritual Identification**.
  - This includes not only mechanical items, but also whether some artworks have obvious signs of forgery.
  - This explanation of the vision cannot be recorded or stolen.

### Item Improvement

You improve the things you hold; this benefit comes from understanding an item through identification.

- **Use:** As a **Full-Round Action**, you improve the effect of an item (this does not include extraordinary items).
- **Prerequisites and constraints:**
  1. An item improved by you must first undergo **Spiritual Identification** (spiritual appraisal) by you, so that you can fully understand it.
  2. The item to be improved must have room for improvement.
     - An item improved by you or others cannot be improved again.
     - You can still use this ability to change one benefit into another benefit.
  3. A high-Sequence **Beyonder** can change the improvement of a low-Sequence Beyonder to a higher-rank or other version through knowledge.
- **Effect:** Choose 1 of the following benefits to apply to this item:
  - Strengthen the duration by 1d4 rounds.
  - Get an extra chance to use it every day (not adding actions such as casting spells and attacking).
  - Extra 1d6 damage.
  - Other additional advantages that may exist and are allowed by the **GM**.
    - Mechanical wonders can also get this benefit.
    - If it is made by you, no **Spiritual Identification** is required before improvement.
- **Limits:** This is a potion effect and cannot be recorded or stolen.
- **Progression:**
  - Each time you advance **1 Sequence**, you may add one additional **non‑repeating** benefit to an improved item.
  - Each time you advance **1 Sequence**, an item improved by you can have up to **3 repeated benefits** total.
