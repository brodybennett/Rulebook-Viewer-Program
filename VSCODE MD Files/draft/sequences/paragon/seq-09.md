# Paragon Pathway: Sequence 9

## Savant

> **Lore:** Believing that knowledge is power, Savants have a cursory grasp of the occult and a stronger proficiency in chemicals and intricate mechanisms—seeming to “know it all.” Their core talent is awakening memory: recalling everything they have read while improving comprehension and learning speed.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +2.
- **Rapid Learning (skills):** Process manufacturing, physics, engineering, mechanical maintenance, and chemistry can be quickly learned.
- **Course-Based Skill Increase:** Each time you receive at least 2 hours of non-repetitive and effective corresponding guidance, choose one skill that matches the course; that skill increases by 1 grade.
  1. Unlike other methods, your learning takes effect immediately after the 2-hour course ends. You only need to learn once to be proficient, advanced, and proficient in training, and you can learn up to 2 skills a day when you reach proficiency at most. [[UNCLEAR: Skill-rank phrasing and the “proficient…proficient in training” wording is inconsistent in this section.]]
  2. This benefit has been included in the rapid learning skills, but it is only calculated independently, so the benefits will not be enjoyed repeatedly. [[UNCLEAR: “Included… but calculated independently” and “not enjoyed repeatedly” are unclear in how they interact.]]

- **Character Creation (not newly promoted):** When creating a character who is not just promoted, use the Inspiration from the [[Triple Potion]] to add [[Growth Skills]]. [[UNCLEAR: “Not just promoted,” “triple potion,” and “growth skills” are not defined in this section.]]

### Wake Up Memory

- **Cost:** 3 **Spirituality Points**.
- **Use:** 1 **Swift Action**.
- **Effect:** On your next skill check, one of your skills improves by one tier for that check:
  - Untrained acts as trained.
  - Trained acts as proficient.
  - Proficient acts as advanced.
- **Limits:** This ability can reach advanced level at most.

### Fast Learning

- **Effect (training time):**
  1. You can use one day to train a skill to be trained, and one week to train to be proficient. It takes two weeks from proficiency to advanced, four weeks from advanced to proficient, two months from proficient to erudite, and half a year from erudite to master. [[UNCLEAR: The “advanced to proficient” step reverses the apparent progression order, but the timing is reproduced as written.]]
  2. The **GM** can limit the stacking skills. For example, investigators can only learn a few skills at most, and several skills can be advanced.
     - Usually, except for potions, the group can’t learn more than 3 kinds, and can’t exceed advanced level.

### Practical Assemblies

- **Special:** Strictly speaking, this is not a transcendent ability, but an introduction to applying awakened memory. Therefore, this ability cannot be stolen or recorded. Having awakened memory means possessing this ability.
- **Requirements:** Prepare enough materials, usually obtained in the [[Black Market]], [[Steam Church]], or from informal vendors.
- **Use (assembly time):**
  - Perform 1 **Full-Round Action** to assemble items such as firearms, rifles, nitroglycerin.
  - Large devices (such as textile machines) require 10 minute.

- **Examples (checks and results):**
  - **Difficulty Value 15** craft manufacturing appraisal: Assemble a pocket watch, or a pistol (appearance fully customizable depending on whether it is steam style or not). Weapon-related damage is taken from [[Weapon Paradigm]].
  - **Difficulty Value 20** chemical identification: Produce aqua regia and nitroglycerin.
    1. If you want to use them in battle, you need to roll identification; you produce an explosion. Damage is 2d6 poison and 1d6 fire, ignoring 2 points of armor. Two people standing together are regarded as the same target.
    2. Because they are inherently dangerous, your throws will definitely have a -4 disadvantage, and a big failure will hurt yourself. These are more suitable for non-combat or exploration.
  - **Difficulty Value 15** pharmaceutical identification: You need to make distillation equipment and other equipment first; you can make ordinary medicines (cold medicines, painkillers). They have no supernatural effect, but are slightly better than some ordinary pharmacists.
  - **Difficulty Value 15** craftsmanship and Deception check: Create an imitation of an object, similar only in appearance.
  - **Difficulty Value 20** craft manufacturing and corresponding scientific appraisal: Manufacture tools/devices for academic or manufacturing research (e.g., stills, telescopes).
  - **Difficulty Value 15** craft manufacturing identification: You need to manufacture a device such as a spinning machine first; you have manufactured high-quality clothing with customizable appearance.
  - **Difficulty Value 20+** crafting check: Make crossbows and rifles. A steam rifle would involve breaking the law.

- **Heavy weapons:**
  - For heavy weapons, **GM** should restrict. To manufacture heavy weapons, you need the consent of **GM** and relevant materials; they are not easy to find.
  - During battle, heavy weapons generally cannot be temporarily assembled because 1 set of materials is difficult to carry. If the Extraordinary brings almost nothing else, or brings a large backpack, they are allowed to carry at most 1 set.

- **Feasibility and research time:**
  - The identification of the feasibility of other theories should be in line with this era. Even if you know more advanced knowledge, it usually takes a month of research and trial and error because no one explores—unless you are a time traveler.

- **Combat timing note:**
  - If you temporarily create during combat, you cannot take any other actions, including free actions, until the creation is complete. The “1 full round” time usually refers to your next turn.

### Spirit Vision
- **Use:** 1 **Free Action** to activate.
- **Cost:** 1 **Spirituality Point** per round.
- **Effect:** While Spirit Vision is active, you gain the following benefits:


  1. **Etheric body:** You can roughly tell whether the other party’s body is good or bad through aura color, but you can’t get detailed information.
  2. **Spiritual body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality; this cannot identify extraordinary people.
  3. **Mental body:** You can see whether the other party is thinking, but only that; you cannot get more detailed information.
  4. **Astral body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5. While in the state of spiritual vision, your spiritual intuition test +1 is beneficial. [[UNCLEAR: “+1 is beneficial” is reproduced as written; whether these are separate effects is not defined here.]]

- **Notes:**
  - Creatures that are dead are usually dull in color and cannot be identified.
  - Spiritual materials are usually spiritual, but you cannot determine the corresponding path.
  - The colors seen by Spirit Vision allow you to see each other in the dark, but you can only see the existence of colors; it is still possible to get lost in the dark because the colors you can see are limited. You cannot use them to distinguish the undead biology.
  - **Sequence 7:** You can determine the path corresponding to extraordinary objects; see [[Spiritual Perception]] for details.
  - Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default if they have not dissipated for 24 hours, and cannot be recorded or stolen.
