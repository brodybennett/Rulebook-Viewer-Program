# Youth Dragon Pathway: Sequence 6

## Hypnotist

- Enhanced physical fitness and defensive scaling via **Dragon Scale**.
- Hypnosis in non-combat scenes: modify consciousness and influence the subconscious.
- Combat hypnosis: force abnormal behavior in battle.
- Psychological stealth: reduce your presence by hiding in a “dead corner of consciousness.”

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:**
  - [[Pituitary Gland (Young Psychic Dragon)]]
  - [[Spinal Fluid (Black Hunting Monitor Lizard)]]
  - [[Psychedelic Wind Chime Tree Fruit]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Agility (DEX) +2, Constitution +2
- **Skill:** **Psychological Guidance** can be learned and mastered quickly.

### Dragon Scale

- **Use:** 1 **Free Action** to toggle.
- **Effect:** Your body surface condenses fine, strong golden scales. Gain **Armor** +3 and **External Damage Reduction** 5. The scales can be hidden within the skin.

- **Sequence Scaling:** At Youth Dragon Pathway Sequence 5, you do not need to display Dragon Scale; under normal circumstances (without using [[Force]]), your skin is difficult to pierce and you gain **Armor** +3 and **External Damage Reduction** 5. When Dragon Scale is actually turned on, these become **Armor** +5 and **External Damage Reduction** 8.

### Non-Combat Hypnosis

- **Cost:** 1 **Casting Action**; 3 **Spirituality**
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target who is either:
  - **Focused** (see below), or
  - **Dazed / Semi-comatose** (see below).
- **Limits:** Hypnosis is distinct from [[Psychological Suggestion]] and can affect the subconscious.
- **Effect:** You use clear words the target can hear to formulate hypnotic content. Typically, you and the target must be within 5 meters.

#### Valid Targets

- **Focused (Concentrated Attention):** A creature is considered to be concentrating as long as they are in front of you and have not roleplayed “keep their minds active and divergent.”
  1) **Focused targets** can only be hypnotized in scenes that are not in combat/chaos, and only if they have not performed the above roleplay.
- **Dazed / Semi-comatose:** Even in battle/chaos scenes, a target in this state can be hypnotized. This generally includes:
  - a target just waking up after a dream, or
  - a target dazed for other reasons and unable to choose to sleep completely.

#### Process Notes

- For either valid target state, once conditions are met you must formulate the hypnotic content with clear words the target can hear (typically within 5 meters).
- **Subconscious effect:** Hypnotic content can cause actions against the target’s true will, and the target cannot perceive they have been affected.
- You may formulate the following hypnotic content:

1) **Forget Memory:** The target truly “does not remember” the chosen memory (this is not merely “not remembering”). You may set a condition under which the memory can be recalled, or set no recall condition.
   - **Special:** If the forgotten memory is associated with important matters or leaves a serious psychological shadow, then when the target witnesses a stimulating reappearance related to that memory, they may attempt a Will Test against the hypnotist’s “Intuition + [[Charisma]] + [[id:alias-psychological-guidance|Psychological Guidance]]” as the difficulty to recall the memory.

2) **Subconscious Behavior:** Specify an action and trigger conditions. When the conditions are met, the target completes the action in an unconscious state. The action must be simple; complex processes must be built from multiple simple hypnotic instructions.

3) **Specified Action:** Specify an action and trigger conditions. When the conditions are met, the target inexplicably thinks it should be done now and then acts. Compared to (2), the behavior can last for a long time, though the content is still simple.

4) **Poor State:** Specify a trigger condition; duration up to 5 minutes. During this period, the target believes they are in a bad state and finds it difficult to do anything. Skill and attribute appraisals remain at -2 disadvantage.

5) **Tell the Truth:** Specify a trigger condition or event; you compel the target to tell the whole thing.

6) **Hallucinations:** Specify a creature/object or a condition; you modify the target’s cognition of the corresponding object as they perceive it.

7) **Mental Body Communication:** A hypnotic technique that still follows the corresponding identification. You may communicate directly with a target’s [[Mental Body]] and feel the target’s current emotions (typically via coordinated, comforting words).

8) **Modify Memory:** Based on (1), you describe what the target “experienced (false)” in the vacated memory. If the false memory is not reasonable enough, it may lead to an identification to resist hypnosis.

9) **Other logical hypnosis allowed by the **GM**.**

#### Other Factors Affecting Hypnosis

1) **Target is not voluntary:** Hypnosis requires **Psychological Guidance** to contest Willpower Defense and uses the same bonus/penalty logic as [[Psychological Suggestion]].

2) **Hypnosis without satisfying any conditions:** The penalty to **Psychological Guidance** is doubled (round up).

3) **Content involves life/important things/strong resistance:** When performing related actions, the hypnotized creature may use an rd20 + Will + Intuition appraisal to contest the difficulty of the hypnotist’s “Intuition (INT) + Charisma + Psychological Guidance bonus” and release the hypnosis.
   - **Special:** In other cases, the target cannot resist hypnosis. However, if the target�s Will = 6 and your Sequence is not higher than the target�s Personality, each time the target would perform an unwilling action they may attempt a Will Test against your hypnosis Difficulty (Intuition (INT) + Charisma + Psychological Guidance). On a success, the action is not performed; 3 total successes break the hypnosis.

4) **Both target conditions met:** If the target is both Focused and Dazed/Semi-comatose, your **Psychological Guidance** appraisal gains +4 favorable.

5) **Content too explicit:** If the hypnotic content is not euphemistic enough (e.g., directly mentions “hypnosis”), or is contrary to the target’s character/style, the target’s opposed identification gains +2 beneficial.
   - Example principle: indirect phrasing is less likely to trigger this modifier than directly instructing with conspicuously controlling language.

6) **Indirect guidance avoids strong-resistance trigger:** If someone strongly resists going to the [[Church of the Earth]], directly mentioning that in hypnosis triggers Factor (3). If you instead say something like “follow someone,” and the followed person goes there, then (3) does not apply (indirect guidance prevents the (3) effect).

7) **Release:** When hypnosis is broken or released, at that moment the target remembers all encounters that occurred during the hypnosis.

8) **Capacity and complexity:** A single hypnosis may instill multiple items (“First… Second… Third…”). The total number of items a creature can bear cannot exceed Intuition (INT)/2 (also related to the maximum number of times psychological hints can be shared). Compared to Psychological Suggestion, hypnosis can be slightly more complicated, but a single piece of content should not exceed 80 words.

9) **Mental illness:** Hypnosis and Forget Memory cannot truly treat mental illness. The memory must later be reminded and the content accepted via **Psychological Guidance**; otherwise the target suffers 1d3/1d6 [[Sanity / Rationality]] loss immediately upon remembering the memory (1d3 for minor memories, 1d6 for major or traumatic memories).

### Combat Hypnosis

- **Cost:** 1 **Swift Action**; 3 **Spirituality**
- **Use:** 1 time per round.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within your [[Field of Vision]].
- **Effect:** Compulsively hypnotize the enemy; contest with **Psychological Guidance** against **Willpower Defense**.
  - You formulate hypnotic content as in Non-Combat Hypnosis, but it **cannot** involve the target’s life/important matters; if it does, the hypnosis is invalid.
- **Duration:** 1 round.
- **Limits / Aftereffects:**
  - The target can be made to attack teammates, but cannot be made to attack itself.
  - After performing the compelled action, the target wakes immediately.
  - You can also make the target’s attack fail to hit; after execution, the target is wide awake.

### Psychological Stealth

- **Cost:** 1 **Casting Action**; 3 **Spirituality**
- **Targeting and range:** You may include companions within 5 meters.
- **Effect:** You and chosen companions enter **Psychological Invisibility** (not true invisibility).
- **Limits / Detection:**
  1) Psychological Invisibility is not real invisibility. Real invisibility means you cannot see the other party; Psychological Invisibility means you can see the other party but ignore them. Therefore, it ignores illusion/special visual detection.
  2) Psychological Invisibility only reduces presence. If your presence becomes stronger, you will be noticed. If you talk to people or interact with the environment while in Psychological Invisibility, anyone who perceives that interaction will discover your existence. If they discover you and then shout to tell others you exist here, you are completely exposed.
  3) In addition to (2), discovery can occur via indirect factors (e.g., perceiving your malice). Footsteps and other detectable traces can expose you; for example, a listener may use [[Listening]] to contest your [[Stealth]]. Anything that cannot be concealed can lead to exposure.
