# Sequence 5: Dreamwalker

## Dreamwalker (Adult Dragon)

> **GM Note:** Dream-based manipulation works through the dream as an entry point, using the astral body as a springboard to influence the spiritual body and then the mental body (rooted in the subconscious). Compared to direct hypnosis, this method is described as softer, more concealed, and harder to detect. [[Astral Body]] [[Spiritual Body]] [[Mental Body]] [[Subconscious]] [[Hypnosis]]

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main Materials:** A dream catcher’s heart; a mind phantom crystal; **or** the complete brain of an adult mind dragon.
- **Auxiliary Materials:** The blood of an adult psychic dragon.

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Find a harpy in the Spirit World, sign a contract with it, take one of its tail feathers, then consume the potion while experiencing a violent emotion of joy or anger. [[Harpy]] [[Spirit World]] [[Contract]]
- **Promotion Effect:** Upon promotion, the Extraordinary falls into their own dream and may sink into it, unable to wake. Strong or intense emotions are needed to resist the illusion and realize they are dreaming, allowing them to wake. Otherwise, the promotion may get out of control.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Agility (DEX) +1, Constitution +1, Intuition (INT) +1.

### Dream Guidance

- **Cost:** 1 **Casting Action**; 3 **Spirituality**. Casting Action [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** You must be in a dream and within 10 meters of the dream owner (within the dream).
- **Effect:** You guide the target step by step through changes in the dream, leading them to reveal the secrets in their heart.
- **Limits:**
  - The guided development must not contradict the current dream content.
  - The guided development must be related to the dream owner’s subconscious. [[Subconscious]]
- **Notes (rules text):**
  - Unlike Dream Modification, Dream Guidance guides the dream owner’s consciousness; it can draw out information you do not already know (for example, details you are investigating).
  - The guided content does not need to be “reasonable” as long as it is not contradictory and is relevant; it can be produced and can change the dream’s content.
- > **Lore:** The pupils suddenly sway with illusory circular ripples; the ripples sink into the depths and fade into darkness and tranquility.

### Dream Modification

- **Cost:** 1 **Casting Action**; 3 **Spirituality**. Casting Action [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** On the premise that you are in a dream, you modify the dream content according to your will (this is not guiding another’s subconscious).
- **Effect:** Modifying the dream affects the target over time, causing unconscious changes and pushing them to do things they would not otherwise do.
- **Limits and procedure (rules text):**
  - **Once per day:** Choose what you want to change the target’s character into, and what you want to guide them to do. Only once per day, you should enter their dream that night while they are dreaming and let the dream content develop in the direction you intend.
  - **Dream channeling option:** Whenever you channel in a dream, you can use psychological channeling against the target’s will defense, and you suffer the same bonuses and penalties as psychological channeling. If a “big failure” is considered, you must take the time to channel 1 time to make up for it. [[Psychological Channeling]]
  - **5 identifications:** If psychological guidance skill identification is successful against the identification for a total of 5 times, you are deemed to have successfully performed the psychological guidance ability once. The target will follow the development action you arranged when encountering the corresponding event in reality; the rest of the judgments follow the psychological guidance ability. [[id:alias-psychological-guidance|Psychological Guidance]]
- **Special (rules text):**
  - You can use your hypnosis ability in other people’s dreams, then use Dream Modification and/or Dream Guidance to cover up the image of you hypnotizing them in the dream. After hypnosis is lifted, they cannot lock onto you as the source; the changes become “soft hypnosis.” [[Hypnosis]]
  - **Psychic channeling only:** As long as you are not discovered in the dream, you may affect targets up to 1 Sequence higher than you when using **Psychological Channeling**.
- > **Lore:** Example from the rules text: To make the target fall in love at first sight, fabricate a beautiful relationship in the dream where the lover resembles the real person; when they meet in reality, they feel an indescribable affection.

### Dream Shuttle

- **Passive:** You can perceive the dreams of intelligent creatures within 500 meters. Before you shuttle into a dream, you can perceive the dream owner’s fuzzy Sequence level (or that they are an ordinary person). If the dream owner’s **Personality** is higher than yours, the dream is judged unsafe; otherwise it is judged safe.
- **Active**
  - **Cost:** 1 **Casting Action**; 2 **Spirituality**. Casting Action [[Spirituality]]
  - **Targeting and range:** An intelligent creature within 500 meters. [5]
  - **Effect:** Your physical body and spirit body enter the chosen creature’s dreamland together. You can jump between two dreamlands to complete a physical “Flash.”
- **Limits (rules text):**
  - Dreamwalkers do not have the ability to stay awake in a dream and pull others into a dream.
  - To stay awake in a dream, you must give yourself psychological hints in advance.
  - To make others fall asleep, you can only try to cooperate with hypnosis. [[Hypnosis]]
