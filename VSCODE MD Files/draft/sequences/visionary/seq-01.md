# Visionary Pathway: Sequence 1

## Author

> **Lore:** A Writer can subtly steer others’ thoughts and actions so they feel like their own ideas, making the influence hard to detect. They can also weave “real nightmares” into reality, drawing many creatures into the unfolding story without noticing—until it ends in the cruelest, most frightening way. Through layered coincidences, a Writer can turn many lives toward tragedy.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual (Unofficial Ceremony):** Write a script that includes all “man-made characters” in a city, then make it reality. Reality should not deviate too much from the script’s development. Under a dramatic plot arrangement, at the end of the story—or in the emotional aftermath after it ends—drink the [[Potion]] once you are fully convinced the story has become reality.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Intuition (INT)** +3  
- **Charisma** +2  
- **Strength** +1  
- **Constitution** +1  
- **Agility (DEX)** +1  
- **Writing Skill** increases by two levels. [[Writing Skill]]

  Usable once per Round. Round You must use pen and paper or spoken words to make

- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality**. [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** **Free Action**. [[Actions]] Usable once per **Round**. Round You must use pen and paper or spoken words to make the arrangement.
- **Effect:** You directly arrange a “reasonable” piece of content to become reality, creating coincidences and developments that follow the logic of the world.
- **Limits:**
  - The content you write or say must conform to reality’s logic and be organized in a reasonable way; whether it is “reasonable enough” is a subjective judgment.
  - If what you wrote is more unreasonable and does not properly take hold, you must pay **3 more** points of **Spirituality** to correct and achieve it, and explicitly add the line: “this is a reasonable development.”
  - This is limited to developments that are still plausibly able to occur (even if unlikely). Otherwise, the effect will not be achieved, and the realized outcome may differ from your intended arrangement.
  - It does not work to write an outcome with no process (e.g., designating someone to suddenly commit suicide at the beginning). Extremely severe distortions of reality require a spiritual price far beyond what a normal realm of **Spirituality** can pay.
  - If sufficiently “reasonable,” this arrangement can indirectly affect some decisions of [[Sequence 0]] within a small range.
  - If you try to influence similar high-level beings (including [[Angels]])—even indirectly through forced guidance—the required **Spirituality** consumption increases geometrically and becomes nearly impossible. To pursue such goals, you must guide step by step over a long period: arrange small details of life, begin with small matters, and build indirect influence gradually.

> **GM Note:** “Reasonableness” and success probability depend on the specific situation and the logic of the setting. If the arrangement is both reasonable *and* dramatically compelling, it often has a higher probability of success.

> **GM Note (Examples):**  
> - Reasonable: Someone helped an apple seller earlier; later, that seller gratefully gives them a whole bag of apples.  
> - Less tenable: Someone “happens to” pick up a bag of fresh, unowned apples on a busy commercial street purely by luck/coincedence.
