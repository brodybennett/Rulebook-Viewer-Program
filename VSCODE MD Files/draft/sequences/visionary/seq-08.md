# Sequence 8: Mind Reader

> **Lore:** Observation is no longer limited to superficial details, but goes deeper into mysterious areas such as the [[Aura]] and [[Etheric Body]]. This combination lets “mind readers” grasp people’s hearts with high accuracy and seem able to read each other’s thoughts—making secrets difficult to keep.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main Materials:** Complete pituitary gland of an adult colorful lizard; 10 ml of spinal fluid from Falsmann rabbits
- **Auxiliary Materials:** Chestnut spores ×5 grams; dragon tooth grass powder ×8 grams; pure white fairy flower petals ×3; pure water ×100 ml

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +2; **Charm** +1  
  - This **Charm** represents personality charm and does not affect your appearance.

### Psych/Psycho Channeling

- **Effect:** Your [[Psych/Psycho Channeling]] stages can be raised to [[Mastery]] quickly.

### Mind-Reader State

- **Use:** Passive and Active
- **Effect:** You can read shallow thoughts and know what emotional response someone has to a situation.

- **Passive:**
  - You can directly see the target’s [[Aura]] / emotional color without relying on vision (see [[id:alias-spirit-vision|Spirit Vision]] for details).
  - Your [[Observation]] status while observing a target’s mental/aura state remains **+4 beneficial**.
  - Only for those who can conceal themselves related to [[Performance]] / [[Deception]] ability, the bonus exists but does not apply.  
    [[UNCLEAR: The +4 clause is self-contradictory about when it applies—especially regarding concealment via Performance/Deception.]]
  - **Observing Emotions:** You can see the other person’s real-time emotions by default, but [[Instigator]] / [[Trickster]] / [[Clown]] can hide their existence.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “Hide their existence” is unclear—whether it hides emotion visibility, the user’s detection of them, or something else.]]

- **Active:**
  - As long as you take the initiative to roleplay (RP) the false emotions you want to show, any behavior that tries to guess your [[Psychology]] has its identification Difficulty increased by your **(Inspiration + Charm + Psychology)** bonus.
  - You must continue to RP for every response for this to take effect.
  - **Special (GM Procedure):** The GM should not announce the increased identification Difficulty. If the identification exceeds the original Difficulty but not the increased Difficulty, the GM provides the mind reader’s false emotions as false information.

### Thinking Simulation

- **Use:** 1 [[Casting Action]]
- **Cost:** No [[Spirituality]] is consumed.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose a creature you know; the target does not need to be present.
- **Effect:** You initially simulate other people’s thinking. You learn the target’s possible emotional reaction to something. If your input information is wrong, your simulation may produce the wrong result.

- **Detailed Judgment (Thinking Simulation):** Make a [[Psychological Appraisal]] and obtain information based on the result:
  1. **Difficulty 10:** You know the psychological activities the target will have about a certain thing.
  2. **Difficulty 15:** In addition to the above, you also know the reaction the target will make, the words they will say, and the behavior they will take.
  3. **Difficulty 20:** In addition to the above, you accurately predict the target’s reaction and know how to lead things to a result beneficial to you, so that an unfavorable possibility will not truly happen.
  4. **Difficulty 25:** In addition to the above, you not only know the target’s reaction, but also know how other things around them will react after they do so (e.g., what other people will do if they fail to escape; what happens to them).
  5. **Big Success:** Based on your success level, you seem to have a specific picture of this possibility in your mind. If your mental simulation used wrong information, you discover something is wrong at this time—but you can only know *which* information is wrong.
  6. **Big Failure:** You still obtain corresponding information, but the simulated content contains seemingly reasonable fatal errors—half-truths and half-false.

- **Other Rules (Thinking Simulation):**
  1. **A target you don’t understand:** You can’t mentally simulate it.
  2. **Repeated thinking simulation:** Before getting new clues, repeated thinking simulation only gets the same result.
  3. **Bonus of understanding level:** Your Thinking Simulation appraisal is equal to **−8 disadvantage** of [[id:alias-psychological-guidance|Psychological Guidance]]. Every time you meet the ③④⑤⑥⑦⑧ in Psychological Guidance, your appraisal is reduced disadvantageously like Psychological Guidance.  
     [[UNCLEAR: The “−8 disadvantage” rule and the reference to levels ③–⑧ in Psychological Guidance are not defined here and cannot be resolved from this text alone.]]
  4. **Things you don’t know:** Like other mental abilities, the content you simulate does not involve information you don’t know, so there may be half-truths and half-false content.
