# Sequence 3: Dream Weaver

## Dream Weaver

**Pathway:** [[Visionary Pathway]].
> **Lore:** You can weave dreams and pull objects into them, shaping near-real images that strike at spiritual weaknesses and erode spiritual defenses.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Influence the dreams of at least 1,000 people within the ‚Äúsea of collective subconsciousness.‚Äù Change how those dreams develop into the outcomes you want, then weave the development of all 1,000 dreams together‚Äîwithin your own dream‚Äîinto a single reasonable story where all dream contents unfold simultaneously in one world from different perspectives. At the end of the story (the end of the stage), drink the potion.

> **GM Note:** Marked ‚Äúunofficial ceremony‚Äù in the source text.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +1; Strength +1; Constitution +1; Agility +1.

### Dream Weaving

- **Cost:** 5 [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** [[Casting Action]]
- **Targeting and range:** One or more creatures within sight
- **Effect:** Drag the targets into a dream. The targets immediately fall asleep and are pulled into the dream state.
- **Sleeping targets:** Attacking a sleeping target grants a **+2 beneficial** bonus, and the target is considered [[Bound]]. The target gains no bonus to [[Physical Defense]] from [[Agility]].
- **Dream world behavior:** In the dream world, things are usually no different from the real world. You are free to negotiate, but people in the dream usually do not lie.
- **Realizing it is a dream:** A creature that passes a [[Inspiration Test]] (Difficulty Value 15) realizes it is in a dream.
- **Waking by effort:** A creature that is aware it is in a dream can use a [[Free Action]] each round to make a [[Will Test]] (Difficulty Value 15). On success, it wakes up from the dream.
- **Waking by damage (if unaware):** If a creature is unaware it is in a dream, it wakes up immediately if it is damaged in the dream or in reality.
- **Further description:** [[Nightmare on the Path of Darkness]]

> **GM Note:** The source text includes the following Dream Weaving expansions for higher Sequences. Keep these with their respective Sequence entries during compilation.
>
> - **Sequence 2:** You can weave consciousness and weave the words spoken by others (you must clearly speak those words out). You weave them into a web of consciousness and place it into the other party‚Äôs [[Spiritual Island]]. This invisible net turns the other party‚Äôs words into a ‚Äúcontract‚Äù effect, so the other party will definitely do what was spoken.
>   - If the ‚Äúcontract‚Äù stipulates that certain things cannot be said, then in situations where those things might be said, the other party will not feel the desire to say them at all, and they will not realize it is because of this net; it appears reasonable.
>   - Because the net is constructed by the other party‚Äôs own [[Spirituality]], even if you become an [[Angel]], you are powerless to remove it.
>   - To use this ability on an angel, you need at least voluntary consent: the angel must voluntarily speak the contract content, or you must ‚Äúlet‚Äù them speak the contract content.
>   - Although it is called a contract, it is not actually a contract; it is an extraordinary power at the psychological level. According to the original book‚Äôs depiction, even if this ability passed through the [[Gray Fog]], it did not suffer from ‚Äúantivirus.‚Äù
>
> - **Sequence 1:** You can pull others into your dream, including their spirit and body. You can build everything in this dream, and the scope of influence can span the entire continent.

### Psychic Phantom

- **Cost:** 3 [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** [[Free Action]]; once per round
- **Effect:** Create an almost-real phantom.
  - You determine the phantom‚Äôs image and content.
  - The phantom is essentially an illusion, but it does not need to be attached to a dream.
  - It can exist in reality within your sight or within your [[Range of Influence]].
  - As long as the enemy thinks it is real, then it is real (to the affected object). The phantom cannot cause any substantial damage, but in the eyes of the affected object it provides feedback as real, allowing the affected target to fight it ‚Äúout of thin air.‚Äù
- **Seeing through the illusion:** A creature that realizes it is false can, each round as a free action, make a [[Will Test]] (Difficulty Value 15) to see through the illusion. If successful, all damage previously dealt is negated.
- **If never realized to be false:** If the phantom is never realized to be false, then the phantomís damage does not cause any physical manifestation. Eventually, the target may die from psychological shock (no physical damage is recorded); immunity to mind-affecting effects prevents this outcome.
