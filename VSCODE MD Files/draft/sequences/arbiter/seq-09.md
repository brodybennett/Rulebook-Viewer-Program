#### Moderate crimes

(robbery of things important to the original owner, indecent, intentionally wounding, vandalism, burglary, etc.)

1. **“Surrender!”**: The target must confess its crime and criminal intent, and be arrested by you voluntarily; this lasts for 1 round.
2. **“Confession!”**: Similar to but not the same as self-surrender; it does not necessarily admit the crime, but it will expose the criminal process and accomplices.
