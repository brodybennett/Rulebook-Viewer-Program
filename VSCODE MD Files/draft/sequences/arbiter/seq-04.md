# Sequence 4

## Law Mage

A Law Mage can **prohibit** specific behaviors within a defined range, and can also **deprive** a target of a specific **Beyonder** ability. Its core principle is: **â€œmystery is weakened, reality is strengthened.â€**

> **Lore:** In the mundane world, this is considered a powerful tool for militaries to counter extraordinary individuals.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** For a country with far-reaching and long-standing problems, formulate a system that can solve its fundamental problems, then secure implementation and effective feedback with the approval of national leaders. (Unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Intuition (INT) +1, Agility (DEX) +1, Strength +1, Constitution +1
- Legal skills increase by 1 skill level. [[Legal Skills]]

### Law of Truth

**Law of Truth:** â€œMystery is weakened here, and reality is strengthened.â€

- **Cost:** 5 points of **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** 1 **free action**; treated as a **spoken law** [[Spoken Law]]
- **Timing:** Takes 1 **round** to gradually take effect.
- **Area:** Within a radius of 1 kilometer.

**Mystery is weakened (extraordinary effects):**
- You are also affected by this ability (â€œincluding oneâ€™s ownâ€).
- **Damage from extraordinary powers:**
  - If the extraordinary power does **not exceed your Personality**, all **final damage dice** are treated as **1d5**. [[Personality]]
  - If it **exceeds your Personality**, the full effect is **halved**. (Damage and/or duration.)
  - Teleportation assisted by the **Spirit World** requires **two rounds**; the activation is still treated as a **free action**, but the teleportation takes two rounds to complete. [[Spirit World]]
- **Other extraordinary abilities:** Suffer the same â€œhalf effect.â€
- **Non-damaging extraordinary abilities** (e.g., nightmares and illusions):
  - Targets can clearly distinguish illusion from reality.
- **Control-check requirements** caused by extraordinary abilities are **halved**.
  - Example: If the Difficulty Value to identify/break free is 20, it becomes 10. Difficulty Value
- **Extraordinary self-strengthening abilities:** Are halved; their **range** is halved and their **duration** is halved.
  - This does **not** affect Constitution that was already enhanced by the potion.
- Example (range-halving): An extraordinary ability that normally works on others only by being next to them must instead be applied by **physical touch**.

**Reality is strengthened (mundane effects):**
1. The damage dice of all weapons increase by **2d6**.  
   When the maximum possible roll total exceeds **40**, the final weapon damage is increased by **half**.
2. All attributes of ordinary people **+3**; all skill identification **+4**.
3. Add **5 points of temporary armor** to all ordinary people in response to extraordinary abilities.
4. The benefits of **Personality Suppression** are all **halved**. [[Personality Suppression]]
   - Because angels essentially have two levels of Personality Suppression improvement for ordinary people and middle/low Sequences, the halving only returns it to one level, so there is no special calculation.
5. The incomplete form of **mythical creatures** can no longer affect the sanity of ordinary people, unless the creature has fallen to the brink of madness; the sanity test against complete mythical creatures is **halved**. [[Mythical Creatures]]
6. For weak undead creatures and various activated summons (e.g., activated flesh and blood, plants that attack by themselves instead of manual operation):
   - Total damage die becomes **1**.
   - Movement range is **halved**.
   - Only **one action** can be performed each round.
   - Their â€œdue deathâ€ is thus re-enhanced.
   - If an undead creature or summoned object has extraordinary characteristics, it counts as an extraordinary person; if it is still â€œone bit lowerâ€ than the Law Mage while being extraordinary, its damage dice is no longer 1 but **1d5**, but it still suffers halved movement range and only one action per round.  

**Sequence 2 note (for this decree):**
- The scope extends to a **city**.
- Undead creatures and summons that are not extraordinary **die on the spot**.
- All benefits on the reality side are **doubled**.
- The complete mythical form can no longer affect the sanity of ordinary people.
- All Personality Suppression must be reduced by **one level** and then **halved**; it cannot become a negative number.  
  Sequence 2 Upgrade

### Make a Contract

You make a contract that cannot be broken.

- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** A **Casting Action**. Casting Action
- **Requirement:** Mutual consent.
- **Effect:** You create a sacred contract that cannot be violated.
  - The contractâ€™s terms prevent prohibited content from occurring in an **objective** sense.
    - Example: If buying an item is prohibited, then when faced with that item, the signatory fundamentally has no desire or ability to buy it.
  - This is an objective limitation shared by both parties, so it cannot be violated.
- If there is a situation that could be violated under special circumstances, the **GM** must impose a serious punishment that matches **Party Aâ€™s Personality**. [[Party A]]

### Practitioners of Order

- **Effect:** You can distinguish ordinary people from extraordinary people by their different â€œpositions,â€ and judge the level of extraordinary people based on this.
  - This is limited to **Sequence** level only, not the **Pathway** they belong to. Sequence Level Pathway
- **Aura:** You can actively release a solemn and majestic aura so that enemies below demigods do not dare raise their heads or launch attacks, including some extraordinary creatures.
  - **Cost:** No obvious Spirituality consumption.
  - **While this aura is active:**
    - Enemy identification and damage are **-4**.
    - An enemyâ€™s active attack requires at least a **Difficulty Value 20** will identification. [[Will Identification]]

**Sequence 2 note (aura):**
- Below the angel level: those below the demigod level must pass a **Difficulty Value 30** will test before they can attack you.
- It is difficult for them to curb their desire to surrender, and they do not dare raise their heads.
