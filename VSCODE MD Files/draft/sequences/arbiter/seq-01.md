# Sequence 1: Hand of Order

> **Lore:** This Sequence can stop chaos by separating combatants into distinct battlefields, standing in an independent position to control influence. It can sense changes in order.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Become the leader of a country's order; make the system you formulate a moral and legal benchmark that subjects will not violate (even in their hearts); and make the system you formulate part of the social norm. *(Unofficial ceremony.)*

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Charisma +3, Inspiration +1, Dexterity +1, Strength +1, Constitution +1
- **Skill Gain:** [[LINK LATER: Law Skill | type=term | hint=skill and skill-level system]] increased by 1 skill level

### Hand of Order

You can make the rules of the world to a certain extent—rules that cannot usually be violated—and cause them to become reality.

- **Cost:** **5** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource/spend rules]] (total)
- **Use:** **Free action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action timing/limits]]
- **Effect:** You formulate a **world law** that is regarded as a law and becomes real. Common types include:

1. **Divide the battlefield:** Formulate a chaotic area as a rule where combatants cannot interact with each other under world laws.
   - Example: You divide a lobby into different small worlds. Physically it still seems whole, but mystically it is separated into different small rooms.
   - Use case: Divide a chaotic battle so enemies become one-on-one with each other.
   - **Restriction:** Extraordinary powers cannot be remotely applied to each other, except for enhanced attributes that were applied in advance.

2. **Prevent related forces from being generated (by rule):** A related force cannot be generated (e.g., sacred, light, flame, corruption, shadow).
   - You can specify up to **two** powers.
   - This does not affect corresponding creatures that have already appeared, but it can prevent them from using related abilities.
   - If the corresponding creatures that appear are not half-god, they will most likely die on the spot due to the loss of these powers.
   - [[LINK LATER: Half-God | type=term | hint=power tier/category]]

3. **Create an independent space (based on battlefield division):**
   - This space can be regarded as having a partial concealment effect, making it difficult to be discovered by establishing a corresponding order.
   - Or use this to make a certain [[LINK LATER: Sealed Item | type=item | hint=item category and sealing rules]] completely independent—or even a kind of thing—so as to complete the effect of the seal.

#### Setting the Difficulty Value to Violate the Law

- When specifying any of the above rules, roll **two** of your **Law + Charisma** values, then choose **one** roll as the **Difficulty Value** (**Difficulty Value**) for someone trying to violate this rule. [[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=mechanic | hint=how DV checks work]]
- Breaking through this Difficulty Value allows the violator to achieve the desired effect. This requires the corresponding [[LINK LATER: Skill Test | type=mechanic | hint=skill check rules]] or [[LINK LATER: Will Test | type=mechanic | hint=will check rules]] to fight.
- A breaker is immediately regarded as a **criminal**, so they will be allowed to be judged. [[LINK LATER: Criminal | type=condition | hint=status and consequences]] [[LINK LATER: Judgment | type=mechanic | hint=how judging works]]

#### Penalties to Break Through

- Breaking through this order requires a **-4** penalty.
- For each **Sequence** level the enemy is lower than you, the identification of violating this order will suffer another **-4** penalty.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “identification of violating this order” is not defined—unclear what roll it applies to and how it differs from breaking through the Difficulty Value.]]
