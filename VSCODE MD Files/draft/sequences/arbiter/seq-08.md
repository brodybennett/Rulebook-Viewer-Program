# Justiciar Pathway: Sequence 8

## Sheriff

- If you have seen a real person, a photo, or a sketch, you can firmly remember the target’s appearance and gain extra induction on the extraordinary level.
- You can detect abnormal factors and grasp traces that are not obvious.
- When close enough, you can detect unshielded things related to [[Evil/Chaos/Madness]].

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:** A pair of eyes of the [[Fear Insect]], the right palm of the [[Silver-White War Bear]].

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Strength** +1
- **Constitution** +1
- **Agility (DEX)** +1
- **Intuition (INT)** +1
- **Tracking** and all attack skills increased by 1 level. [[Tracking]]

- Whenever you apprehend/solve a non-repeating, challenging enemy by stalking or chasing clues, your Tracking skill goes up by 1 level; the number of growths required is GM-defined (typically based on the Sequence 9 cap and reputation boost).

You gain extra senses at the extraordinary level. You can remember a target’s appearance and detect abnormal factors.

- **Occult Memory**
  1. You acquire a photographic memory of portraits, real images, routes traveled, event clues, habits, and image features.
  2. You can recall these things at any time, and you can see through the camouflage of living/dead things, but you can’t see through the camouflage that completely hides habits, smells, and characteristics (such as [[Faceless People]]). You can remember them by painting and other methods without identification. The content is reproduced.
     - You can recognize each other based on their characteristics just by passing by, and you can also recognize them based on their previous appearance.

- **Evil/Chaos/Madness-Related Perceptions**
  3. You can immediately detect the gaze on you within 50 meters, or detect the crime that just appeared in the line of sight, but the information is vague.
  4. You can detect the cast/effect of abilities such as darkness, fall, immortality, and curse within 50 meters, and you can continue to lock the location until they disappear. This does not count as the upper limit of [[Locking]] and does not include corresponding creatures, but includes creatures that have [[Lost Control]]/semi-runaway.
     - Note: Ability (4) includes both distortion of order and chaos of rules, and the ability to isolate space with distortion is only noticed for a moment.

- **Tracking/Reconnaissance**
  5. You can get the (4) benefit for your gaze. If you recognize the existence of the characteristic thing you remember within 50 meters, you can also get the (4) benefit. Lock the location of living or dead objects, but only lock 1, and only get direction information; out of range ability reset.
  6. When you have this ability, your detection and listening will continue to be +2 beneficial, and you can include non-obvious clues into the scope of identification.

- **Special**
  - Only (4) applies for the perception of evil and heterogeneous things. If the corresponding thing is shielded by an [[id:alias-anti-divination|Anti-Divination]]/[[Spiritual Wall]], it will not be perceived, and the spiritual wall cannot be used to continuously envelop the entire body.
  - This is a [[Potion Effect]]; it cannot be stolen or recorded, and the detection of extraordinary powers with **Status/Rank higher than 1** may cause [[Spiritual Alarms]].

- **Effect:** Extraordinary Reconnaissance resolves using its yaml ability block and section prose.
- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.


## Jurisdiction

> **Lore:** The more familiar the place, the better you can play it.

Outside the scope of your Jurisdiction, you can only rely on extraordinary ability.

**Jurisdiction** definition:
- A place where you often stay for 3 days and know enough is considered a Jurisdiction.
- If you have obtained the actual jurisdiction of a certain area, it will be considered a Jurisdiction after you understand the map and social conditions of the area.
- There are two types; Jurisdiction does not conflict.

Example:
- The place where the Jurisdiction is taken away but you know enough is still regarded as Jurisdiction.

Within your Jurisdiction, you gain the following benefits:
1. The perceivable range of Extraordinary Reconnaissance is doubled, but it cannot exceed the scope of Jurisdiction.
2. Within Jurisdiction, all your skills and attribute appraisals gain an additional +2 benefit.
3. Your reputation increases by 1 level, which can exceed the upper limit, but it still does not affect your assets.
4. You will not fail in Jurisdiction, but the expansion of the probability of [[Major Failure]] can still cause you a major failure; the expanded probability of major failure is reduced by 1 value. For example, 1, 2, and 3 of rd20 are considered major failures; you only have 1, 2.

- **Sequence 6:** When in a Jurisdiction, the coverage of your [[Law]] is doubled. [[id:alias-sequence-6|Sequence 6]]
- **Sequence 5:** When in a Jurisdiction, the coverage of your [[Punishment]] is doubled. [[Sequence 5]]
