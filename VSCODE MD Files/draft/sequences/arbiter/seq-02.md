# Sequence 2: The Balancer

## Overview

- You can sense imbalances in the surrounding area and detect hidden targets.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Let the chaotic things that have been out of order for hundreds of years become a part of harmony and balance with today’s social order. (unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Charisma +3; Intuition (INT) +1; Agility (DEX) +1; Strength +1; Constitution +1.
- **Skill Gain:** [[Law skill]] +1 skill level.

### Sage's Balance

- **Use:** **Free Action** Free Action.
- **Cost:** 5 **spiritual points** [[Spirituality]] (total).
- **Targeting and range:** Choose a designated area within 1 kilometer of you as the center (includes you and everyone in the area).
- **Effect:**
  - You “balance” the designated area by speaking the corresponding **law** (decree). [[law (decree)]]
  - Determine the **strongest** and **weakest** Sequence levels present in the area and use them as the benchmark.
  - Set everyone in the area (including you) to the same “intensity” Sequence level:
    - Add the strongest and weakest Sequence levels, divide by 2, and **round up** to a whole Sequence level.
    - Example: if the strongest is Sequence 1 and the weakest is Sequence 9, then (1 + 9) ÷ 2 = 5, so everyone becomes Sequence 5.
  - Existing higher-Sequence abilities do not disappear, but their **strength** is reduced to match the balanced Sequence level.
  - Any Beyonder weaker than the balanced Sequence level is promoted to that level immediately in **personality** and strength, but does **not** gain higher-Sequence abilities.
  - Within the affected area, there is no more **personality suppression**. [[Personality Suppression]]
  - Additional adjustment for targets above your Sequence:
    - For each Sequence level an affected person is higher than you, their resulting balanced Sequence level is **-1**.
    - Example (using the Sequence 1 vs Sequence 9 case above): even if others become Sequence 5, if you are Sequence 2 and apply this to a Sequence 1, that target’s resulting level becomes Sequence 4 (not Sequence 5).
  - Special case—**King of Angels**:
    - A King of Angels is treated as a separate personality improvement. If the enemy is a King of Angels, their personality is raised by another level on the basis of Sequence 1. [[King of Angels]]
  - This does not change the outcome for other low-Sequence Beyonders in the area: all low-Sequence Beyonders are still promoted to the corresponding Sequence 5 level, regardless of whether the strongest exceeds your Sequence level.
  - Leader adjustment when an existence “breaks through the limit”:
    - If an existence successfully breaks through your restriction via high-level status, then **only for you**, your Sequence level in this law is **+1**; otherwise, calculate as usual.

- **Limits and calculation notes:**
  - All resulting Sequence levels are **rounded up**.
  - Example: if the weakest is Sequence 4 and the strongest is Sequence 1, then (4 + 1) ÷ 2 = 2.5, which rounds up to Sequence 3 (not Sequence 2).
  - Ordinary people affect the calculation and are treated as a value of **10**.
    - For convenience, unless Beyonders intentionally do so, only count those who join the battlefield when calculating.
    > **GM Note:** Plan the law’s effective scope to avoid including ordinary people unintentionally, since they can change the result.

- **Effect on ordinary people:**
  - Ordinary people do not gain any supernatural powers.
  - They avoid the personality coercion brought by supernatural powers, but whether they still suffer suppression depends on the final promoted personality present.
  - Example: if an ordinary person becomes a “transcendent” at Sequence 5, but someone breaks through the limit and reaches Sequence 4, they will still suffer suppression of Sequence 4 against Sequence 5, but they will be suppressed by the “substitute person.”> **GM Note:** This decree can take effect in any city, but if you are a “wild” Beyonder, it may cause the city’s forces to chase you. [[wild Beyonder]]

### Balancer

- **Effect:** You sense imbalances in the order around you.
- **Use:** When hidden, invisible, corrupted, dark, undead, or other forces that violate the order are present, you may immediately make a **legal appraisal** against the enemy’s **will defense** and locate the corresponding target.
  - [[Legal Appraisal]]
  - Willpower Defense
- **Targeting and range:** 1 kilometer radius.

- **At Sequence 1:** Expands to a city, and you can know how the corresponding imbalance appeared and the general ins and outs of the subsequent whole thing. [[id:alias-sequence-1|Sequence 1]]
