# Judge Pathway: Sequence 3

## Chaos Hunter

> **GM Note:** “The number of Extraordinary abilities that can be taken away has greatly increased.” appears in the source, but no procedure, limits, or target rules are provided in this section.  
> [[UNCLEAR: The text references “taking away” Extraordinary abilities without stating how that mechanic works.]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Based on the law, resolve a state-level chaos that has been swept up, **or** hunt and bring to justice an angel-level or near-angel-level existence with “chaos” as its core, greater than the Sequence 3 level. (unofficial ceremony)  
  [[UNCLEAR: “greater than the Sequence 3 level” is unclear in scope/criteria (e.g., how to measure or apply it).]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +1, Dexterity +1, Strength +1, Constitution +1.
- Legal skills increase by 1 skill level.

### Chaos Hunter

- **Effect:**
  - From now on, you and your disciplinary knights gain a +4 bonus in skill identification and damage identification for all criminals and undead, corrupt, dark, and other natural forces that affect order.
  - For the [[LINK LATER: Black Emperor Pathway | type=pathway | hint=referenced as “Black Emperor path”]]: +8 skill bonus, +4 attribute check; damage check bonus unchanged.  
    [[UNCLEAR: The “damage check bonus unchanged” line conflicts with/does not cleanly map to the earlier “damage identification” bonus language.]]
  - **Order’s sight:** Within a kilometer of you, or when you are in your **jurisdiction**, order becomes your eyes.
    - You make up to two laws based on the realms of unholy, undead, fallen, and dark.
    - When corresponding behaviors or creatures appear in your jurisdiction, they are considered violators of the law and become criminals.
    - You can immediately cast sight from a distance and perform a **trial**.
      - If a trial is held, your connection with the other party is reduced, immediately interrupted, and cannot be tracked again within half a day.
      - Without a trial, you can continue to observe the criminal through the boundaries of the district.
  - This is considered a [[LINK LATER: Divination | type=mechanic | hint=“divination or prophecy effect”]] or [[LINK LATER: Prophecy | type=mechanic | hint=“divination or prophecy effect”]] effect and will be affected by corresponding [[LINK LATER: Counter-Divination | type=mechanic | hint=opposes divination/prophecy]].
    - It usually does not work well for spirit creatures and spirits.
    - It will not trigger the [[LINK LATER: Witch’s Curse | type=condition | hint=referenced as “the witch’s curse”]].
- **Limits:**
  - Up to two laws may be made (as above).
  - After you hold a trial (as above), you cannot track that target again within half a day.

- **At Sequence 2:** Anyone who violates the system you have established, or the system under your jurisdiction, is included in your sight in the jurisdiction.

### Messenger of Order

- **Use:** Once per [[LINK LATER: Round | type=mechanic | hint=turn structure timing]], as a [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]], eliminate:
  - a power related to darkness, corruption, and undead domains, **and**
  - curses on your body.
- **Limits / Modifiers:**
  - For curses higher than your Sequence level, the effect is halved, and a free action is also consumed.

> **GM Note:** Starting from this Sequence, due to a lack of information on the extraordinary abilities in the original work, some abilities of the Judge Pathway (Sequence 3–0) are original to the supplementers.
