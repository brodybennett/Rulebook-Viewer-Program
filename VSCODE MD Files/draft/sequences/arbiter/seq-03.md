# Judge Pathway: Sequence 3

## Chaos Hunter

> **GM Note:** â€œThe number of Extraordinary abilities that can be taken away has greatly increased.â€ appears in the source; treat this as using the **Invalidation Law** procedure.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Based on the law, resolve a state-level chaos that has been swept up, **or** hunt and bring to justice an angel-level or near-angel-level existence with â€œchaosâ€ as its core, **Sequence 2 or higher**. (unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +1, Dexterity +1, Strength +1, Constitution +1.
- Legal skills increase by 1 skill level.

### Chaos Hunter

- **Effect:**
  - From now on, you and your disciplinary knights gain a +4 bonus in skill identification and damage identification for all criminals and undead, corrupt, dark, and other natural forces that affect order.
  - For the [[Black Emperor Pathway]]: +8 skill bonus, +4 attribute check; damage identification bonus remains **+4** (unchanged from the baseline above).  
  - **Orderâ€™s sight:** Within a kilometer of you, or when you are in your **jurisdiction**, order becomes your eyes.
    - You make up to two laws based on the realms of unholy, undead, fallen, and dark.
    - When corresponding behaviors or creatures appear in your jurisdiction, they are considered violators of the law and become criminals.
    - You can immediately cast sight from a distance and perform a **trial**.
      - If a trial is held, your connection with the other party is reduced, immediately interrupted, and cannot be tracked again within half a day.
      - Without a trial, you can continue to observe the criminal through the boundaries of the district.
  - This is considered a [[id:alias-divination|Divination]] or [[id:alias-prophecy|Prophecy]] effect and will be affected by corresponding [[Counter-Divination]].
    - It usually does not work well for spirit creatures and spirits.
    - It will not trigger the [[Witchâ€™s Curse]].
- **Limits:**
  - Up to two laws may be made (as above).
  - After you hold a trial (as above), you cannot track that target again within half a day.

- **At Sequence 2:** Anyone who violates the system you have established, or the system under your jurisdiction, is included in your sight in the jurisdiction.

### Messenger of Order

- **Use:** Once per [[Round]], as a [[Free Action]], eliminate:
  - a power related to darkness, corruption, and undead domains, **and**
  - curses on your body.
- **Limits / Modifiers:**
  - For curses higher than your Sequence level, the effect is halved, and a free action is also consumed.

> **GM Note:** Starting from this Sequence, due to a lack of information on the extraordinary abilities in the original work, some abilities of the Judge Pathway (Sequence 3â€“0) are original to the supplementers.
