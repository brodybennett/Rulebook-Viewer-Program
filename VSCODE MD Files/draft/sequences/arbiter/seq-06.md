# Sequence 6: Judge

## Judge

Set new rules for a certain area. Everything in the area must abide by the rules and act; if they violate them, they will be bound by the rules.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- Strength +1
- Constitution +1
- Agility +1
- Inspiration +1
- You can start to learn **Law** more quickly.

- Whenever you, as a judge, sum up the guilt of a certain type of non-repetitive case and pronounce a verdict based on appropriate reasons and standards that meet the crime, your legal skills will rise by 1 level.
- For growth and restrictions, refer to [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9: Most Knowledgeable | type=sequence | hint=growth and restrictions reference]].

### Authority

> **Lore:** You have indescribable majesty, which is a qualitative change in the ability of the [[LINK LATER: Arbitrator | type=ability | hint=prior extraordinary ability that Authority upgrades]].

- **Cost:** None (no **Spirituality Points** required).
- **Use:** 1 **Free Action** to turn on/off.
- **Targeting and range:** All targets within 50 meters.
- **Effect:**
  1. All creatures immediately feel your majesty. Their skill/attribute evaluation is **-2 disadvantageous** (a kind of fear).
  2. Except for the fear caused by you, the emotions of all creatures within the range will not have a substantial impact, but they still exist. Exploding desires can still force people to act, but continuous compulsory action will only take effect once, and the explosion of desires will still be effective.
  3. Targets lower than your Sequence level will not be able to look directly at you, and targets lower than your level will directly bow their heads and feel oppressed.
- **At Sequence 5:** The effect of (1) is changed to a real fear effect, but it will not force the target to move.  
  [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=Authority upgrade point within the same Pathway]]

### Prohibition!

You set new rules for a certain area; everything in the area must follow the rules and act.

All Laws below require speaking the language that leverages the power of nature to use.  
[[LINK LATER: Language that leverages the power of nature | type=term | hint=required spoken language for Laws]]

- **Cost:** 2 Spirituality Points.
- **Use:** 1 **Swift Action**, 1 time per round.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 room/house within 50 meters (range) to affect.
- **Effect:** Push your palm forward and say: “This place is forbidden (forbidden content)!” You formulate a rule that everyone must obey.
- **Counteracting the prohibition decree:**
  - One must first act contrary to it.
  - “Relevant attributes are identified as the difficulty of ‘Law + Inspiration + Will’ against the judge.”
  - It is forbidden to use Inspiration to fight against teleportation, and it is forbidden to use Agility to fight against concealment, and so on.
  - Even if you succeed in countering the law, your actions can only take effect once, and you still need to continue to fight the next execution.
  - If the confrontation fails, the action you perform will not be refunded.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The Prohibition counteraction procedure does not clearly specify which side rolls/sets difficulty beyond the quoted line.]]
- **Limits:**
  - You can maintain at most prohibitive laws equal to the number of your Inspirations.
  - Stacking the same laws will double the difficulty.
  - The content of the laws must be specific and not broad. (Example: not all desires can be banned, but individual desires can be prohibited.)
- **Other rules:**
  - Violating your laws is not considered a crime.

**Choose one of the following Prohibition types when you declare it:**

1. **Prohibited ability/behavior**
   - You read out a type of extraordinary ability or prohibited behavior; the two are not contradictory.
   - Examples:
     - “Teleportation is prohibited here!”: [[LINK LATER: Spirit World Shuttle | type=ability | hint=example teleportation ability]], [[LINK LATER: Flame Leap | type=ability | hint=example teleportation ability]], [[LINK LATER: Moon Flash | type=ability | hint=example teleportation ability]], etc. cannot be executed, but does not include swapping positions.
     - “Hiding is prohibited here!”: [[LINK LATER: Invisibility | type=ability | hint=example hiding ability]] / [[LINK LATER: Shadow hiding | type=ability | hint=example hiding ability]] is forced to reveal. [[LINK LATER: Wraith | type=ability | hint=spirit-body state/ability]] is still a spirit body but exposed. Stealth behavior in the conventional sense will also force the body to leave the bunker so that the appearance is exposed to everyone.
     - “Flying is prohibited here!”: Flying units will immediately begin falling to the ground, but gliding/floating is not considered flying.
   - A sentence of prohibition does not necessarily have only one content, but at most two. (Example: “Flying and floating are prohibited here!”)  
     The two concepts banned together should be similar (example: flying is similar to floating; stealing is not similar to cheating).
   - **Special:** More than 1 character will still be blocked by the law, but can consume 1 more spellcasting/attack to successfully execute the ability.  
     [[UNCLEAR: “More than 1 character” is not defined and may refer to a power/grade concept not explained here.]]

2. **Forbidden to exist**
   - You read out that a creature type is forbidden, and the corresponding creature will be excluded immediately.
   - Examples:
     - “Ghosts and ghosts are forbidden here”: ghost/ghost creatures are immediately repelled from the ruled area you designate and unable to enter again.
     - “Zombies and skeletons are prohibited here”: same effect as above.
   - To resist the forbidden existence, you need to make 1 **Will test** at the beginning of each round.
   - **Special:**
     - Direct prohibition of existence is invalid for targets with more than 1 character.  
       [[UNCLEAR: “More than 1 character” is not defined and may refer to a power/grade concept not explained here.]]
     - You must specify a type of creature; it cannot be broad. (Example: you can prohibit ghosts/living corpses/skeletons, but you cannot directly prohibit “the dead” and the existence of creatures.)

### Imprisoned!

> **Lore:** The surroundings of the target become viscous, as if forming a huge amber, or enclosing a sealed transparent wall.

- **Cost:** 3 points of Spirituality.
- **Use:** 1 **Spellcasting Action**.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target.
- **Check:** Inspiration + Law against physical defense; ignores armor.
- **Effect:**
  - The target is considered to be in a [[LINK LATER: Bound State | type=condition | hint=state applied by Imprisoned]].
  - The target’s attack/displacement cannot reach the outside world, but the outside world can attack the target.
  - To escape, it needs to cause damage equal to the judge’s “rd20 + Inspiration + Law” to the wall. The external damage will also damage the wall when it hits the target.
  - **Special:**
    - Spiritual bodies cannot pass through the wall from the inside, but can enter from the outside.
    - Imprisonment is divided by area rather than creatures, so creatures that are possessed or overlapped will be imprisoned together.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The damage threshold expression “rd20 + Inspiration + Law” is not defined elsewhere in this section (e.g., whether “rd20” is a specific die/roll).]]

### Confinement!

> **Lore:** The whole environment suddenly froze, as if there was an invisible barrier that even spirit bodies could not penetrate.

- **Cost:** 3 Spirituality Points.
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose a room/building or area within 50 meters.
- **Effect:**
  - Instantly inflicts the same effect as Imprisoned on the area you choose, but in the form of pure invisible walls.
  - Until you cancel the spell or the wall is destroyed, no existence can escape here, and the displacement cannot reach the outside world.
  - Sound in the confinement environment will not be transmitted to the outside (equivalent to being isolated).
  - If a creature is located at the edge of the confinement range when the confinement is just cast, and can escape the range by taking actions to avoid the confinement effect, then perform a countermeasure equivalent to confinement.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The edge-case “countermeasure equivalent to confinement” procedure does not specify how it is resolved (timing/check/etc.).]]

### Release!

> **Lore:** You disintegrate the invisible prison around you.

This ability has two uses:

1. **Release your own effects**
   - **Cost:** None.
   - **Use:** 1 **Swift Action**, 1 time per round.
   - **Effect:** Release a kind of Imprisoned/Confinement effect you created.

2. **Release another binding/sealing effect**
   - **Cost:** 3 Spirituality Points.
   - **Use:** 1 **Spellcasting Action**.
   - **Targeting and range:** Choose within 50 meters; you can choose a target other than yourself.
   - **Effect (as written):**
     - For non-spiritual binding/sealing effects: Inspiration + Legal substitution corresponding break-away identification; if not, against the caster’s Inspiration + Will identification.
     - For each Sequence the caster is higher than you: Inspiration + Legal Check -2 disadvantage.
     - For every 1 character higher than you, the caster: Inspiration + Legal identification -2 disadvantages; 2 higher than you ignore great success.
     - The binding/closing effect achieved by the [[LINK LATER: Black Emperor | type=pathway | hint=approach that creates distortion-based binding/sealing]] approach through distortion falls into this category.
     - Distortion of behavior/intent, or an effect of loss of action similar to shock/spiritual body string, as long as there is no material restraint, does not belong to this category.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “Legal substitution corresponding break-away identification,” the stacking of the Sequence/“character” disadvantage rules, and “ignore great success” are not defined clearly in this section.]]

### Whip!

> **Lore:** Make the target seem to be hit by an invisible soft whip; the clothes are broken, the flesh is split open, and the bones are exposed.

- **Cost:** 2 points of Spirituality (first attack).
- **Use:** 1 **Attack Action**.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within 5 meters.
- **Check:** Inspiration + Law against physical defense.
- **Effect:**
  - When you swing your right hand, you are considered to have an invisible soft whip.
  - You deal 1d6 + half-strength damage dice; the damage is rounded up.
  - You can attack up to three times in a row and make three identifications. Each additional identification consumes 1 more Spirituality Point.
- **Special:**
  - This essentially allows you to hold an invisible soft whip as a weapon, so your original weapon has no effect.
  - (Whiplashes created with the Law cannot be synergized with [[LINK LATER: Whip of Pain | type=ability | hint=synergy restriction]].)

### Exile!

> **Lore:** Create an invisible majestic force that can even blow away spirit bodies.

- **Cost:** 3 Spirituality Points.
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within 50 meters.
- **Effect:**
  - You specify 1 direction; the target will be thrown.
  - How many meters will be thrown depends on your “Inspiration + Law.”
  - No need to identify.
  - You can choose air; stop after hitting an obstacle.
  - For every 2 points of Constitution the target has, the distance to be thrown is reduced by 1 meter (which may cause 1d6 physical damage from the fall).
- **Special:** For non-corporeal creatures such as spirits/ghosts, for every 3 points of Agility, the distance to be thrown is reduced by 1 meter.

### Death!

After declaring the target dead, you cause powerful damage.

- **Targeting and range:** Select a target within 50 meters.
- **Use:** This ability has the following two uses:

1. **Melee collision**
   - **Cost:** 8 points of Spirituality.
   - **Use:** 1 **Attack Action**.
   - **Check:** Inspiration + Legal identification against physical defense, ignoring agility and dodge; excluding targets that can [[LINK LATER: Avoid light/lightning | type=mechanic | hint=exclusion clause for Death]].
   - **Effect:**
     - Your body is united with some strange power, dragging afterimages to collide to the enemy.
     - This is a melee effect.
     - The damage you deal will increase by a fixed value of “Inspiration + Law” value; the damage type remains the same.

2. **Ranged body-part judgment**
   - **Cost:** 8 Spirituality Points.
   - **Use:** 1 **Spell-casting Action**.
   - **Check:** Inspiration + Legal identification against physical defense, ignoring agility and dodge; excluding targets that can [[LINK LATER: Avoid light/lightning | type=mechanic | hint=exclusion clause for Death]].
   - **Effect:**
     - You specify 1 of its body parts to only cause “Inspiration + Law” fixation value damage.
     - This is a ranged effect (only for ranged use).
     - It does not take the hit penalty for a vital hit.
