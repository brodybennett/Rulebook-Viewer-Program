# God of War Pathway: Sequence 9

## Warrior

> **Lore:** Anciently known as the “[[LINK LATER: Giant Pathway | type=pathway | hint=ancient name of this Pathway]]” Pathway, whose mythical creature takes the form of a Cyclops.

You gain the following extraordinary abilities.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +2, Agility +1.
- **Rapid Combat Learning:** You can quickly learn combat-related skills.
  1. Whenever you receive **2 hours** of non-repetitive, effective corresponding guidance, your fighting/weapon use/throwing skills corresponding to the guidance content increase by **1 level**.
     - You need **2**, **3**, and **4** times to be trained to be **proficient**, **advanced**, and **proficient** respectively, up to **mastery**. [[UNCLEAR: The tier progression lists “proficient” twice (“proficient, advanced, and proficient”), so the intended final tier for the 4-training step is ambiguous.]]
     - [[LINK LATER: Skill Levels | type=mechanic | hint=training/proficient/advanced/mastery]]
  2. Each time you conduct an actual battle, the enemy must be stronger than you. When you defeat them, this is also regarded as skill growth, and you can only get this once for each enemy.
     - [[LINK LATER: Skill Growth | type=mechanic | hint=what counts as skill growth and its limits]]
  3. When creating a [[LINK LATER: Character Card | type=other | hint=character creation sheet]] that has not just been promoted, you can use the Strength/Agility of the [[LINK LATER: Potion | type=item | hint=Sequence potion benefits]] to add growth skills, and the growth rate is regarded as [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=mechanic | hint=rule term for growth rate]]. [[UNCLEAR: “use the strength/agility of the potion to add growth skills” does not specify how many skills/levels are added or what limits apply.]]

### Extraordinary Fighting

- **Effect:** There are no weapons that you cannot use. You have mastered various fighting techniques, and there is no fighting genre that you cannot master.
- **Features:**
  1. **Armed Identification:** You can directly know the quality of weapons/armors through close observation, without seeing extraordinary factors.
     - [[LINK LATER: Armed Identification | type=mechanic | hint=weapon/armor quality identification]]
  2. **Combat Mastery:** **+2** is beneficial to special action appraisals such as critical strike/double strike/close-in shooting, excluding first aid/surprise attack.  
     It does not affect special actions that simply gain benefits (for example, gaining momentum and aiming will not change from +2 to favorable +4). It affects identification only.
     - [[LINK LATER: Special Actions | type=mechanic | hint=special action appraisals and what “beneficial” means]]
  3. **Combat Skills:**
     - When you perform feints, you can use [[LINK LATER: Fighting Identification | type=mechanic | hint=identification test using Fighting]] instead of [[LINK LATER: Acting Identification | type=mechanic]] / [[LINK LATER: Cheating Identification | type=mechanic]], no matter whether Fighting is proficient or not.
     - When using firearms, if the target is less than **5 meters** away from you, [[LINK LATER: Shooting | type=mechanic | hint=firearms test/skill]] can be changed to Fighting Identification, but the related attribute is **Agility**.
  4. **Mastery of Various Martial Arts:** When you use a weapon, the minimum skill level to use it is **training**, no matter whether it is really trained or not.
  5. **Quick Dodge:** You use skills to retain complete physical defense against guns instead of Light/Lightning, and get an extra level of dodge. [[UNCLEAR: “retain complete physical defense against guns instead of Light/Lightning” is unclear about what is being replaced or compared.]]
     - [[LINK LATER: Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=dodge levels and “extra level of dodge”]]
- **Sequence Upgrade:** At [[LINK LATER: Sequence 7 | type=sequence | hint=upgrade note referenced here]], your Armed Identification can see extraordinary factors, and Quick Dodge is increased by **1** extra level of dodge.
  - [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Factors | type=term | hint=supernatural properties detectable via Armed Identification]]
- **Special:** This is the benefit of the potion and cannot be recorded or stolen.

### Extraordinary Physical Fitness

- **Effect:** Your physical fitness and height have been significantly increased.
- Your maximum Life +2.
- Your height +10 cm. Once you exceed **2 meters**, you are regarded as a [[LINK LATER: Large-Scale Creature | type=term | hint=size category triggered by height]].
- **Sequence Upgrade:** For every sequence you upgrade, your Life +2 and your height +10 cm.
  - Your Life will be up to +10.
  - Your height will be up to **3 meters**.
- **Special:** This is the benefit of the potion and cannot be recorded or stolen.

### Spirit Vision

- **Effect:** You gain **Spirit Vision**, but it is not as effective for you as your own inspiration.
- **Cost and Use:** As **1 [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]**, consuming **1 [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent per round]]** per round, you activate Spirit Vision. While active, you gain the following benefits:
  1. **Etheric Body:** You can roughly tell whether the other party’s body is good or bad through the color of the aura, but you can’t get detailed information.
  2. **Spiritual Body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality, which cannot identify extraordinary people.
  3. **Mental Body:** You can see whether the other party is thinking, but only so, and you cannot get more detailed information.
  4. **Astral Body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5. When in the state of Spirit Vision, your [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition Test | type=mechanic | hint=test modified by Spirit Vision]] +1 is beneficial.
- **Notes:**
  - Creatures that are dead are usually dull in color and cannot be identified.
  - Spiritual materials are usually spiritual, but you cannot determine the corresponding Pathway.
  - The colors seen by Spirit Vision allow you to see each other in the dark, but you can only see the existence of colors. It is still possible to get lost in the dark because the colors you can see are limited, so you cannot use them to distinguish undead biology.
  - Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default, which have not dissipated for **24 hours**.
- **Special:** Spirit Vision cannot be recorded or stolen.
