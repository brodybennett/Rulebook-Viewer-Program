# Sequence 7: Weapon Master

You are able to wield weapons at a master level, including extraordinary weapons, magical items, and seals in the form of swords, guns, and similar objects.

You can effectively reduce the damage caused by negative status effects.

> **Lore:** Your strength, physique, and agility reach a level where weapon mastery feels instinctive.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- Strength +2
- Constitution +2
- Agility +2
- Your weapon-related skills and throwing skills are immediately promoted to Mastery.

### Weapon Use

You gain a series of weapon-specific **special moves**:

- **Sweep:** You sweep all targets in an area.
  - **Use:** 1 **attack action**
  - **Effect:** Your melee attack can select all targets within 1 meter in front of you (large knife: 2 meters).
  - **Resolution:** Use 1 corresponding skill identification to attack the [[Physical Defense]] of all targets at the same time.
  - **Targeting and range:** All targets within the stated distance in front of you (see above).

- **Vertical Slash:** You aim at a target with the weapon from top to bottom, chopping at the target as if cutting off a building.
  - **Use:** **attack action**
  - **Effect:** You slash your weapon at the opponent, breaking the slab of stone.
  - **Damage:** This attack gains a **1d6** damage bonus of the same type as normal.
  - **Sequence 6:** If the identification fails, you can use 1 Strength identification to resist the enemy's Physical Defense once. If the identification is successful, you can use terrifying power to cause it to lose balance. The enemy must be smaller than your size to take effect. This applies only at Sequence 6.

- **Diagonal Slash:** You quickly cut the target obliquely in two.
  - **Use:** 1 **attack action**
  - **Effect:** Apply a -2 penalty to the enemy's Physical Defense (including Agility and Dodge as normal).

- **Straight Thrust:** You direct your attack at the target with precise aim.
  - **Use:** 1 **attack action**
  - **Effect:** When you use this attack to perform a [[Critical Strike]], you take a **-2** penalty on the critical strike.

- **Slap:** You switch from the blade to the side and blast the target with a slap.
  - **Use:** 1 **attack action**
  - **Damage:** This attack will only cause damage = [[Strength Damage Dice]].
  - **Effect:** Ignore **3** points of [[Armor]].
  - **Limit:** Penalties still apply even if values go negative (no floor at 0).

- All the above-mentioned special moves get a bonus of [[id:alias-extraordinary-fighting|Extraordinary Fighting]].
- When used in combination with [[Double Attack]], you can choose different weapons to use the special move for the two attacks.

> **GM Note:** Other GMs allow reasonable special moves.

### Weapon Mastery

As long as it is a weapon, you can use it at a **Master Level** if you hold it in your hand.

1) **Master Level:** When using a weapon, no matter whether your corresponding skill meets the requirements or not, the skill is considered a master.
2) **Extraordinary Weakness:** The negative effects of weapon extraordinary items are halved for you, rounded down.

- This is a passive, but as an extraordinary ability may be lost, you still need to upgrade the real skill to Master.
