# Sequence 6: Dawn Knight

> **Lore:** Possessing giant-like power, you can fill the surroundings with morning light. This light can break illusions, disperse the shadows of resentful souls, and weaken evil spirits.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +2, Agility (DEX) +1, Intuition (INT) +1.
- **Skill Gain:** Occultism +1 level.

> **GM Note:** Your giant strength can make every step you take shake the surroundings; this effect can be controlled.

### Armor of Dawn

As a free action and at the expense of 3 spirituality points, you create a suit of silver-white armor covering your entire body (including gauntlets, breastplates, and crowned helmets, among other pieces). It has no obvious weight.

- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points
- **Use:** Free action
- **Effect:** You gain 5 points of armor and 3 points of external damage reduction.

Different judgments are made according to the following conditions:

1. **Gap (Defense Breached):** If an attack breaks through your physical defense and causes ≥ 10 effective damage, that part of the Armor of Dawn is considered to have a **Gap**.
   - While that part has a Gap, a critical strike there ignores the benefits of Armor of Dawn and gains a damage bonus of 1d6.

2. **Unbroken Defense Limit:** If the attack continues but does not meet the Gap condition above, Armor of Dawn can only provide you with 2 defenses at most on the same body part; from the third time, you can be hit by a vital blow.
   - As long as the opponent’s Identification result is > your Agility (DEX) + Dodge, if it fails, it is regarded as being blocked by your armor.
   - The additional 1d6 damage bonus from a Gap critical strike does not apply under the Unbroken Defense condition.

3. **Repair Armor:** Damage to Armor of Dawn is automatically repaired; a Gap is fully restored after 2 rounds.

- At [[Sequence 5]]: Armor of Dawn is changed to 7 points of armor, 5 points of external damage reduction, and the number of damages that have not broken through the defense is 3 times.

### Gather Dawn

You can gather (condense) different weapons. The strongest is a two-handed giant sword.

- **Use:** 1 Swift Action
- **Cost:** 3 spiritual points
- **Effect:** Condense any one of the weapons below. The weapon lasts for 8 rounds.
- **Borrowing Protection:** When using these weapons to perform the special action of [[Borrowing Protection]], you get the armor corresponding to the volume of the item.

**Special:** If the enemy is no more than 1 Sequence higher than you, when the dawn weapon is about to be destroyed, you can spend 1 spirituality to recast it immediately.

Available weapons:

1. **Sword of Dawn:** The medium/large Sword of Dawn can cause damage of 1d8+Strength / 2d6+Strength damage dice respectively.
   - The large Sword of Dawn is a two-handed giant sword that can attack targets within 1 meter.
   - Against enemies in contact (0 distance), your Identification/attack is at -2 disadvantage.

2. **Dawn Quick Bow:** Deals 1d3 + half Strength damage bonus damage.
   - 1 Attack Action can shoot up to 3 arrows.
   - Each arrow needs to use 1 Swift Action and consumes 1 spiritual concentration.
   - Shooting range (in meters) equals your Strength value.

3. **Dawn Longbow:** Deals 1d8 + Strength damage bonus damage.
   - Same as (2), but 1 Attack Action can shoot only 1 arrow, and the range is twice your Strength value.

4. **Dawn Whip:** Deals 1d4 + half Strength damage bonus damage.
   - 1 Attack Action can attack up to 3 times in a row.
   - You can choose a target within 1 meter.
   - The second Identification is -4 disadvantageous; the third Identification is -6 disadvantageous.

**Special (Cleansing Effect):** Every hit of your Dawn weapon increases the restraint damage by 1d6 against spirit creatures.

- At [[Sequence 5]]: All your Dawn weapons add 1d2 to their base damage.
- [[GM Adjudication]] With GM approval, you can create other reasonable Dawn weapons; all Dawn weapons deal holy damage.

### Create Dawn

You fill the surroundings with bright, clean, and holy dawn, which can break illusions, disperse the shadows of resentful souls, and weaken evil spirits.

- **Use:** 1 Casting Action
- **Duration:** Every 1 point of spirituality lasts for 1 minute.
- **Area:** A dawn field within 50 meters of you as the center; it moves with you.

Effects within the morning sun:

1. The brightness within the range is like dawn; there is no longer shadow and darkness.
2. Within the range, hallucinations from targets up to 1 Sequence higher than you are automatically dispelled.
3. Without Extraordinary characteristics, ordinary wraith shadows are purified immediately. Extraordinary spirit creatures with a certain strength start to suffer 1d6 sacred damage every round, and the skill and attribute evaluation continues to suffer -2 disadvantages.
4. Creatures of fallen/darkness feel uncomfortable at most; this is a narrative effect only unless otherwise specified.

### Storm of Light

You create a storm of light that sweeps the surroundings, which can directly destroy the human body, eliminate resentful souls, and traumatize evil spirits.

- **Use:** 1 Casting Action
- **Cost:** 3 points of spirituality
- **Requirement:** Must be cast with a weapon.
  - If it is a dawn weapon, the consumption of spirituality can be changed to consume its duration of 2 rounds as an alternative.

Choose one of the following:

1. **Insert into the ground:** You insert the weapon into the ground, making it bloom with the color of the morning light, creating a 10-meter Storm of Light centered on you.
   - Resolution: Make a Mysticism check against each creature’s Physical Defense (ignore Agility (DEX) and Dodge bonuses). This attack counts as holy/light for resistances.
   - Damage: Deals 2d6 holy and 1d6 fire damage to all creatures in the area, including you.
   - Armor interaction: You count as a breach of the Armor of Dawn; you lose the Armor of Dawn on your lower body.

2. **Sweep out:** You choose a direction within 10 meters, sweep out the weapon, and create a Storm of Light that sweeps away.
   - Unlike (1), this specifies a direction without harming you.
   - Damage: Causes 2d6 holy and 1d6 fire damage.

**Special:** Storm of Light increases 1d6 damage of divine restraint against spiritual enemies.

- At [[Sequence 5]]: Storm of Light is changed to 3d6 holy and 1d6 fire damage, and does not cause damage to you.
