## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

### Shield of Envelopment (Glory)

- **Use:** As a **full-round action** [[Full-Round Action]], create a shield of glory strong enough to envelop an entire city-state, converging divine radiance into a cage.
- **Effect:**
  - The shield’s **Health** [[Health]] is shared with yours.
  - Your Health increases by an additional 50.
  - The shield conceals and isolates the inside and outside to a certain extent.
  - You may use it to create a seal for yourself, or to isolate yourself from the enemy in a separate small world for a one-on-one duel.
    - As long as the enemy doesn’t defeat you, they can’t get out of that world.
    - **Teleportation** [[Teleportation]] is limited by the shield.
- **Targeting and range:**
  - Envelops an entire city-state.
- **Limits and interactions:**
  - You can isolate yourself with a single chosen enemy for a one-on-one duel while all other creatures are held outside the shield. You may open or close the barrier as a free action (once per round) to allow additional enemies to enter or to release them.
  - Disabling or otherwise changing the shield requires another **full-round action** [[Full-Round Action]] to achieve it, which may cause you to be attacked.
  - If there is any attempt to leave within the shield, you can use a **free action** [[Free Action]] (once per round) to immediately sprint over and perform a **combat attack test** [[Combat Attack Test]] on the target to try to directly interrupt the escape behavior.
    - This does not include ethereal teleportation that is only within the shield’s range and has no real effect.
  - Even if there is an escape, the Glory Shield will immediately repair it and re-seal it immediately, and only that person can escape.
- **Extra:**
  - While in the Glory Shield, your Agility and Will are +2 by default.

> **Lore:** “The city is there, the shield is there, and the glory is there… In a frontal battle, no one can escape. There is only one thing they can do: face you and defeat you.”
