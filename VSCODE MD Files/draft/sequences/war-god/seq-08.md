### Extraordinary Fighting

Your Sequence 9 fighting ability has been improved, so you can master more fighting skills. [[Sequence 9: Extraordinary Fighting]]

- **Double Combo (Special Action):** When you are fighting, you can attack twice with superb skills. [[Special Action]]
  1. When you perform a **Double-Strike** special action, you can make the relevant attribute of the double-strike still be Strength instead of Agility. The effect will not be affected, and the Strength damage dice will still be halved. [[Double Strike]]
  2. Based on the same technique, you can change the relevant attribute of a regular single strike to Agility, and still have the full Strength bonus.
  - At Sequence 7, your double strike is not limited to melee and knives; other melee weapons can also double strike. This does not include weapons or abilities whose Strength damage roll has been halved. [[Sequence 7]]

- **Limb Parry (Special Action):** When you block a **Vital Blow** with a limb, the limb you use to resist is no longer considered as a vital blow. [[Vital Blow]]
  1. When you block with your limbs, the limbs used for blocking are not considered to have suffered **Critical Blows** and will not be disadvantaged. [[Critical Blow]]
  2. If the Agility test of your body resistance is successful, and the enemy is attacking you in melee, then you can use a **Swift Action** to immediately perform a special action of **Grapple** or **Attack With Force**. For Attack With Force, the Strength bonus is halved.  
     [[Agility Test]] [[Body Resistance]] [[Swift Action]] [[Grapple]] [[Attack With Force]]

- **Winning Pursuit:** You have **Advantage** against the enemies you keep hitting. [[Advantage / Disadvantage]]
  1. If you choose the same target with the Fighting (Hand-to-Hand) skill for 2 or more consecutive times, and the continuous identification is successful, then from the second time, you will continue to gain Advantage against them until the continuous attack is interrupted.  
     [[Fighting (Hand-to-Hand)]] [[Continuous Identification]]
  2. If you have achieved a **Great Success** in any attack identification in 2 or more consecutive blows, you will be able to hook his legs and sweep his legs, causing him to fall into an **Unbalanced** state.  
     [[Great Success]] [[Attack Identification]] [[Unbalanced]]
  - At Sequence 7, no longer restricts skills, as long as it is fighting/weapon/throwing skills can be used. [[Weapon Skills]] [[Throwing Skills]]

- **Leg Sweep (Special Action):** You can use your legs instead of your fists without loss. [[Leg Sweep]]
  1. Your Strength damage roll is no longer halved when you perform the leg sweep special action.
  2. In the event of a **Big Failure**, you can immediately use an Agility appraisal (**Difficulty Value** 25) to adjust to avoid disadvantages.  
     [[Big Failure]] [[Agility Appraisal]] [[Difficulty Value]]
  3. Your leg sweep can be used for a double combo.

- **Fighting Tricks (Special Action):** You can use fighting skills to defuse the enemy's fighting skills.
  1. Only when the enemy uses a **Combat Test** against you, you can choose not to use **Physical Defense** to defend against his attack, but instead use the same skill test as him to fight against it. When your test result > his result, you will successfully resist the attack.  
     [[Combat Test]] [[Physical Defense]]
  2. Before using it, you must mention in the RP that you “need to switch to fighting skills instead of **Dodge** to dismantle moves”; otherwise it will be regarded as physical defense confrontation by default, and the opposite RP must be performed when switching back to physical defense confrontation.  
     [[Dodge]] [[RP Declaration]]
  3. The RP must be before the enemy's appraisal, otherwise this appraisal will still be against your physical defense. If your appraisal is not > the enemy's appraisal, then as long as the enemy's appraisal result ≤ your **Armor**, it will still be considered as a resistance.  
     [[Armor]]

- All the fighting skills mentioned above are special actions, and when identified, they will get the benefits of Sequence 9 Extraordinary Fighting, excluding Winning Pursuit. [[Identification]]

> **GM Note:** Other fighting skills that are reasonable may be allowed by the GM.

### Extraordinary Physical Abilities

You can mitigate supernatural influences purely with your own body.

- **Resistance 2** to:
  - Fire [[Fire]]
  - Poison [[Poison]]
  - Cold [[Cold]]
  - Curse [[Curse]]
  - Possibly more damage types that would normally have negative effects (taking into account the Outer Gods approach). [[Outer Gods]]
- This excludes:
  - Psychic effects [[Psychic Effects]]
  - Holy effects [[Holy Effects]]
  - Physical effects [[Physical Effects]]
- [[Resistance]]
- Sequence 7: Changed to 3 points corresponding to resistance. [[Sequence 7]]
- Sequence 5: Changed to 5 points corresponding to resistance. [[Sequence 5]]
