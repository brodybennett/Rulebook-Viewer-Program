# Sequence 8: Fighter

> **Lore:** Known as “Gladiator” in ancient times. Experts in fighting can use their bodies to weaken the effects of certain supernatural forces. Extraordinary characteristic image: a pure light ball like a baby’s fist.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Strength** +1
- **Constitution** +2
- **Agility** +1
- **Inspiration** +1
- Fighting (Melee Combat) can be quickly promoted to Master.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The rules do not specify what “quickly promoted to Master” changes mechanically (time, cost, checks, or prerequisites).]]

### Extraordinary Fighting

Your Sequence 9 fighting ability has been improved, so you can master more fighting skills. [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9: Extraordinary Fighting | type=sequence | hint=baseline ability being improved]]

- **Double Combo (Special Action):** When you are fighting, you can attack twice with superb skills. [[LINK LATER: Special Action | type=mechanic | hint=action category]]
  1. When you perform a **Double-Strike** special action, you can make the relevant attribute of the double-strike still be Strength instead of Agility. The effect will not be affected, and the Strength damage dice will still be halved. [[LINK LATER: Double-Strike | type=mechanic | hint=special action]]
  2. Based on the same technique, you can change the relevant attribute of a regular single strike to Agility, and still have the full Strength bonus.
  - At Sequence 7, your double strike is not limited to melee and knives; other melee weapons can also double strike. This does not include weapons or abilities whose Strength damage roll has been halved. [[LINK LATER: Sequence 7 | type=sequence | hint=progression breakpoint]]

- **Limb Parry (Special Action):** When you block a **Vital Blow** with a limb, the limb you use to resist is no longer considered as a vital blow. [[LINK LATER: Vital Blow | type=mechanic | hint=hit severity category]]
  1. When you block with your limbs, the limbs used for blocking are not considered to have suffered **Critical Blows** and will not be disadvantaged. [[LINK LATER: Critical Blow | type=mechanic | hint=critical hit rules]]
  2. If the Agility test of your body resistance is successful, and the enemy is attacking you in melee, then you can use a **Swift Action** to immediately perform a special action of **Grapple** or **Attack With Force**. For Attack With Force, the Strength bonus is halved.  
     [[LINK LATER: Agility Test | type=mechanic | hint=attribute test]] [[LINK LATER: Body Resistance | type=mechanic | hint=resistance test mechanic]] [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action category]] [[LINK LATER: Grapple | type=mechanic | hint=special action]] [[LINK LATER: Attack With Force | type=mechanic | hint=special action]]

- **Winning Pursuit:** You have an **Advantage/Disadvantage** against the enemies you keep hitting. [[LINK LATER: Advantage/Disadvantage | type=mechanic | hint=roll modifier system]]
  [[UNCLEAR: The text states “advantage/disadvantage” without specifying whether the effect grants Advantage, Disadvantage, or depends on context.]]
  1. If you choose the same target with the Fighting (Hand-to-Hand) skill for 2 or more consecutive times, and the continuous identification is successful, then from the second time, you will continue to gain the advantage/disadvantage of him until the continuous attack is interrupted.  
     [[LINK LATER: Fighting (Hand-to-Hand) | type=skill | hint=skill name as written]] [[LINK LATER: Continuous Identification | type=mechanic | hint=repeat identification requirement]]
  2. If you have achieved a **Great Success** in any attack identification in 2 or more consecutive blows, you will be able to hook his legs and sweep his legs, causing him to fall into an **Unbalanced** state.  
     [[LINK LATER: Great Success | type=mechanic | hint=degree of success]] [[LINK LATER: Attack Identification | type=mechanic | hint=identification roll tied to attacks]] [[LINK LATER: Unbalanced | type=condition | hint=state caused by leg hook/sweep]]
  - At Sequence 7, no longer restricts skills, as long as it is fighting/weapon/throwing skills can be used. [[LINK LATER: Weapon Skills | type=mechanic | hint=skill category]] [[LINK LATER: Throwing Skills | type=mechanic | hint=skill category]]

- **Leg Sweep (Special Action):** You can use your legs instead of your fists without loss. [[LINK LATER: Leg Sweep | type=mechanic | hint=special action]]
  1. Your Strength damage roll is no longer halved when you perform the leg sweep special action.
  2. In the event of a **Big Failure**, you can immediately use an Agility appraisal (**Difficulty Value** 25) to adjust to avoid disadvantages.  
     [[LINK LATER: Big Failure | type=mechanic | hint=degree of failure]] [[LINK LATER: Agility Appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=appraisal check]] [[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=term | hint=target number for checks]]
  3. Your leg sweep can be used for a double combo.

- **Fighting Tricks (Special Action):** You can use fighting skills to defuse the enemy's fighting skills.
  1. Only when the enemy uses a **Combat Test** against you, you can choose not to use **Physical Defense** to defend against his attack, but instead use the same skill test as him to fight against it. When your test result > his result, you will successfully resist the attack.  
     [[LINK LATER: Combat Test | type=mechanic | hint=test used for attacks]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=default defense method]]
  2. Before using it, you must mention in the RP that you “need to switch to fighting skills instead of **Dodge** to dismantle moves”; otherwise it will be regarded as physical defense confrontation by default, and the opposite RP must be performed when switching back to physical defense confrontation.  
     [[LINK LATER: Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=defense option]] [[LINK LATER: RP Declaration | type=mechanic | hint=required in-fiction declaration timing]]
  3. The RP must be before the enemy's appraisal, otherwise this appraisal will still be against your physical defense. If your appraisal is not > the enemy's appraisal, then as long as the enemy's appraisal result ≤ your **Armor**, it will still be considered as a resistance.  
     [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=mechanic | hint=armor threshold for resisting attacks]]

- All the fighting skills mentioned above are special actions, and when identified, they will get the benefits of Sequence 9 Extraordinary Fighting, excluding Winning Pursuit. [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=“when identified” trigger]]

> **GM Note:** Other fighting skills that are reasonable may be allowed by the GM.

### Extraordinary Physical Abilities

You can mitigate supernatural influences purely with your own body.

- **Resistance 2** to:
  - Fire [[LINK LATER: Fire | type=term | hint=damage type]]
  - Poison [[LINK LATER: Poison | type=term | hint=damage type]]
  - Cold [[LINK LATER: Cold | type=term | hint=damage type]]
  - Curse [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=term | hint=damage type]]
  - Possibly more damage types that would normally have negative effects (taking into account the Outer Gods approach). [[LINK LATER: Outer Gods | type=faction | hint=setting concept affecting damage types]]
- This excludes:
  - Psychic effects [[LINK LATER: Psychic Effects | type=term | hint=excluded effect type]]
  - Holy effects [[LINK LATER: Holy Effects | type=term | hint=excluded effect type]]
  - Physical effects [[LINK LATER: Physical Effects | type=term | hint=excluded effect type]]
- [[LINK LATER: Resistance | type=mechanic | hint=damage/effect mitigation value]]
- Sequence 7: Changed to 3 points corresponding to resistance. [[LINK LATER: Sequence 7 | type=sequence | hint=progression breakpoint]]
- Sequence 5: Changed to 5 points corresponding to resistance. [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=progression breakpoint]]
