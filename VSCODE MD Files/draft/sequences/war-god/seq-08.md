Your Sequence 9 fighting ability has been improved, so you can master more fighting skills. Sequence 9: Extraordinary Fighting

- **Double Combo (Special Action):** When you are fighting, you can attack twice with superb skills. [[Special Action]]
  1. When you perform a **Double-Strike** special action, you can make the relevant attribute of the double-strike still be Strength instead of Agility (DEX). The effect will not be affected, and the Strength damage dice will still be halved. [[Double Strike]]
  2. Based on the same technique, you can change the relevant attribute of a regular single strike to Agility (DEX), and still have the full Strength bonus.
  - At Sequence 7, your double strike is not limited to melee and knives; other melee weapons can also double strike. This does not include weapons or abilities whose Strength damage roll has been halved. Sequence 7

- **Limb Parry (Special Action):** When you block a **Vital Blow** with a limb, the limb you use to resist is no longer considered as a vital blow. [[Vital Blow]]
  1. When you block with your limbs, the limbs used for blocking are not considered to have suffered **Critical Blows** and will not be disadvantaged. [[Critical Blow]]
  2. If the Agility (DEX) test of your body resistance is successful, and the enemy is attacking you in melee, then you can use a **Swift Action** to immediately perform a special action of **Grapple** or **Attack With Force**. For Attack With Force, the Strength bonus is halved.  
     Agility (DEX) Test [[Body Resistance]] Swift Action [[Grapple]] [[Attack With Force]]

- **Winning Pursuit:** You have **Advantage** against the enemies you keep hitting. [[Advantage / Disadvantage]]
  1. If you choose the same target with the Fighting (Hand-to-Hand) skill for 2 or more consecutive times, and the continuous identification is successful, then from the second time, you will continue to gain Advantage against them until the continuous attack is interrupted.  
     [[Fighting (Hand-to-Hand)]] [[Continuous Identification]]
  2. If you have achieved a **Great Success** in any attack identification in 2 or more consecutive blows, you will be able to hook his legs and sweep his legs, causing him to fall into an **Unbalanced** state.  
     Great Success [[Attack Identification]] [[Unbalanced]]
  - At Sequence 7, no longer restricts skills, as long as it is fighting/weapon/throwing skills can be used. [[Weapon Skills]] [[Throwing Skills]]

- **Leg Sweep (Special Action):** You can use your legs instead of your fists without loss. [[Leg Sweep]]
  1. Your Strength damage roll is no longer halved when you perform the leg sweep special action.
  2. In the event of a **Big Failure**, you can immediately use an Agility (DEX) appraisal (**Difficulty Value** 25) to adjust to avoid disadvantages.  
     Big Failure Agility (DEX) Appraisal Difficulty Value
  3. Your leg sweep can be used for a double combo.

- **Fighting Tricks (Special Action):** You can use fighting skills to defuse the enemy's fighting skills.
  1. Only when the enemy uses a **Combat Test** against you, you can choose not to use **Physical Defense** to defend against his attack, but instead use the same skill test as him to fight against it. When your test result > his result, you will successfully resist the attack.  
     [[Combat Test]] [[Physical Defense]]
  2. Before using it, you must mention in the RP that you “need to switch to fighting skills instead of **Dodge** to dismantle moves”; otherwise it will be regarded as physical defense confrontation by default, and the opposite RP must be performed when switching back to physical defense confrontation.  
     Dodge [[RP Declaration]]
  3. The RP must be before the enemy's appraisal, otherwise this appraisal will still be against your physical defense. If your appraisal is not > the enemy's appraisal, then as long as the enemy's appraisal result ≤ your **Armor**, it will still be considered as a resistance.  
     [[Armor]]

- All the fighting skills mentioned above are special actions, and when identified, they will get the benefits of Sequence 9 Extraordinary Fighting, excluding Winning Pursuit. Identification

> **GM Note:** Other fighting skills that are reasonable may be allowed by the GM.

- **Effect:** Extraordinary Fighting resolves using its yaml ability block and section prose.
- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
