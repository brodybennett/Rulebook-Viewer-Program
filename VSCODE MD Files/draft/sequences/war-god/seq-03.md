- **Limits:** A binding effect occurs first; during the process, both parties cannot perform any other actions.
- **Duration:** If the submerged target does not break through within three rounds, the target may be stunned or suffocated.

pathway: war-god
sequence: 3
type: active
action: attack
cost: {}
roll: null
opposed_by: physical_defense
range: With teleportation (flash), it can bypass most barriers, directly attack the
  target, and even explode from the targets body. There are almost no signs of condensation,

text: 'Cost: 3 [[Spirituality]] points per Attack Action. Use: This attack counts
  as a [[Raid effect]] and must be used with a [[Raid action]]. Targeting and range:
  With teleportation (flash), it can bypass most barriers, directly attack the target,
  and even explode from the targets body. There are almost no signs of condensation,
  so it is difficult to predict in advance. Check: Fights against [[Physical Defense]].
  Effect: A sharp silver light flashes out of thin air on the target. The damage ignores
  any [[Armor]], [[Cover]], and [[Danger Intuition]] (non-malicious perception). Damage:
  3d12 + raid + Strength damage bonus, as physical or divine damage (choose one).'
```

- **Use:** This attack counts as a **[[Raid effect]]** and must be used with a **[[Raid action]]**.
- **Targeting and range:** With “teleportation (flash),” it can bypass most barriers, directly attack the target, and even explode from the target’s body. There are almost no signs of condensation, so it is difficult to predict in advance.
- **Check:** Fights against [[Physical Defense]].
- **Effect:** A sharp silver light flashes out of thin air on the target. The damage ignores any [[Armor]], [[Cover]], and [[Danger Intuition]] (non-malicious perception).
- **Damage:** 3d12 + raid + Strength damage bonus, as physical or divine damage (choose one).

> **GM Note:** Combined with **Hidden by Light**, if an encounter has already started and you can make yourself disappear in others’ cognition again (so you cannot be locked onto), your next attack can be treated as a surprise attack.

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
