# Sequence 3: Silver Knight

- Your guardian power manifests as a silver full-body armor that can be converted into mercury (see **Mercury**).
- You can use light to hide and conceal malice (see **Hidden by Light**).
- You can condense a “Sword of Dawn” and use it as a conventional weapon; it is sharp and good at purification (see **Sword of Dawn**).
- You can create a “silver rapier” with “teleportation (flash)” (see **Silver Rapier**).
- Abilities vary slightly depending on the blessings received (see **Blessing**).

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Arrange a complex altar. Place the remains of six powerful creatures that you hunted and killed in the correct positions, and receive blessings from [[Angels]] and above.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Agility +1, Constitution +2, Will +2.

### Mercury

- **Effect:** You melt at once, turning into a pool of flowing silver-metal liquid. You can move quickly to avoid attacks, and your movement speed is tripled.
- **Alternate effect:** You can turn into viscous and heavy mercury and flood an enemy, making the opponent seem to be wearing a silver full-body armor without revealing the slightest gap. The armor attempts to suffocate the wearer; the specific effect depends on the specific situation.
- **Limits:** A binding effect occurs first; during the process, both parties cannot perform any other actions.
- **Duration:** If the submerged target does not break through within three rounds, the target may be stunned or suffocated.
[[UNCLEAR: “Break through” is not mechanically defined, and it is unclear what actions/rolls (if any) are possible while “both parties cannot perform any other actions.”]]

### Sword of Dawn

- **Effect:** You can condense a “Sword of Dawn” and use it as a conventional weapon; it is sharp enough and good at purification.

### Silver Rapier

- **Cost:** 3 [[Spirituality]] points per attack action.
- **Use:** This attack counts as a **[[Raid effect]]** and must be used with a **[[Raid action]]**.
- **Targeting and range:** With “teleportation (flash),” it can bypass most barriers, directly attack the target, and even explode from the target’s body. There are almost no signs of condensation, so it is difficult to predict in advance.
- **Check:** Fights against [[Physical Defense]].
- **Effect:** A sharp silver light flashes out of thin air on the target. The damage ignores any [[Armor]], [[Cover]], and [[Danger Intuition]] (non-malicious perception).
- **Damage:** 3d12 + raid + Strength damage bonus, as physical or divine damage (choose one).

> **GM Note:** Combined with **Hidden by Light**, if an encounter has already started and you can make yourself disappear in others’ cognition again—and you cannot be locked onto by this—then surprise behavior in the battle can be established.  
> [[UNCLEAR: “Cannot be locked by this” and the exact mechanical meaning of “surprise behavior… established” are not defined here.]]

### Hidden by Light

- **Cost:** 3 [[Spirituality]] points.
- **Use:** Free action.
- **Effect:** You achieve optical invisibility.

### Blessing

- **Effect:** Depending on the gods who bless you during the promotion ceremony, different Silver Knights will differ: you gain some changes in the Sequence path corresponding to that god. These changes usually have little impact.
- **Examples (non-exhaustive):**
  - Silver Knights blessed by gods of a “god of war” Pathway may have certain enhancements in their various abilities, making them slightly stronger than other Silver Knights of the same level.
  - Your attacks may produce random, preferred, and unpredictable changes under certain circumstances.
  - You may gain a small amount of good or bad luck that can be applied for a short period of time.
- **Reference:** For specific effects in this regard, refer to [[Sequence 4: Mysticist]].
- **General rule:** This kind of mutation will only have a small impact and will not cause a decisive effect.
