# Sequence 4: Demon Hunter

## Demon Hunter

- Sensitive to traces of evil, depravity, and pollution.
- Can cover up one’s own actions and intentions, making targets that can foresee danger unable to detect you.
- A nemesis of demons; skilled at discovering the weaknesses of different monsters.
- Skilled at identifying the uses of various materials and, in a unique meditation mode, formulating and producing miraculous potions, holy ointments, essential oils, and special marks—then restraining the target by taking, smearing, or using these items.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Unilaterally kills an evil, depraved, powerful creature that is heavily tainted, and resolves the root cause of the event so related events do not occur again. (unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** strength +2, agility +1, constitution +2, will +2.

### Detect Evil

- **Use:** **Free Action**
- **Check:** **Difficulty Value 15** [[Inspiration]] + [[Spot]] check.
- **Effect:** Look for signs of evil, corruption, and contamination; detect evil creatures currently within the scene or that have been in the area within the last 24 hours.

- **Cost:** 4 [[Spirituality]].
- **Requirements:** Find the traces of demons and understand the types of demons.
- **Effect:** After the ceremony takes effect, your attack Identification checks of 18, 19, or 20 are considered a [[Big Success]].

### Mind Barrier

- **Effect:** Conceal your intentions.
  - You can surprise creatures that would not otherwise be surprised.
  - A demon’s danger perception no longer applies to you.

### Spiritual Disturbance

- **Effect:** The target makes an [[Inspiration]] check at -5; on failure, treat the result as a [[Big Failure]].

### Material Identification

- **Effect:** Identify the uses of various materials and prepare corresponding magical potions, holy ointments, essential oils, and special marks.
- **Time:** 1d20 minutes.
- **Check:** **Difficulty Value 20** [[Inspiration]] check.
- **Limits:** Create up to five magical items per day.
- **Storage/Duration:** Unless otherwise specified, magical potions can only be stored or effective for 24 hours.

Here’s a list of the magical items you can craft:

- **Holy Anointing**
  - **Use:** **Full Round** to apply.
  - **Effect:** The applier gains 5 **cold resistance** and 5 **curse resistance** for 24 hours.
  - **Limits:** Can only take effect twice.
  - **Additional Effect:** If the curse/cold/poison’s Difficulty Value is within 5 points of your [[Inspiration]] score, you may choose to suppress or cure it.

- **Essential Oil**
  - **Use:** 1 **Round**.
  - **Effect:** The diffused aroma repels dark, corrupted, and undead creatures below **Sequence 7**; on a failed resistance, they must leave the area and cannot enter while the aroma persists.
  - **Additional Uses:** Refreshes the mind so users can continue to act for a period of time when they are tired.
  - **Additional Uses:** Can be dripped on teammates to distinguish friend from foe through the unique aroma.

- **Choking Potion**
  - **Use:** An action other than a **Free Action**.
  - **Aftereffects:** After taking it, you will not be able to breathe air, but you can breathe freely underwater.

- **Mark of Purification**
  - **Use:** An action other than a **Free Action**; attaches to a weapon or object.
  - **Effect:** The next 3 attacks are converted to **holy damage**.
  - **Bonus Damage:** +2d6 against corrupted and dark creatures; +3d6 against undead.

- **Mark of Lightning**
  - **Use:** An action other than a **Free Action**; attaches to a weapon or object.
  - **Effect:** Deals an extra 1d10 **lightning damage** for the next 2 hits.
  - **Bonus Damage:** An extra 3d6 damage to undead.

- **Frozen Mark**
  - **Use:** An action other than a **Free Action**; attaches to a weapon or object.
  - **Effect:** The subsequent three attacks cause **cold damage**.
  - **Aftereffects:** Muscles tremble and frost condenses; the target’s next skill check is at -4 disadvantage.

  - **Use:** An action other than a **Free Action**; attaches to a weapon or item.
  - **Effect:** The damage of the next three attacks is converted into **curse damage**.
  - **Additional Effect:** When applying the mark, specify a category or set of targets that the curse damage will not affect; all other targets are affected normally.

- **Healing Potion**
  - **Effect:** Restores 2d6 health.

- **Purification Potion**
  - **Effect:** Immediately heals all poisons and minor diseases, as well as curses.
  - **Effect:** Causes 3d6 damage to the [[Wraiths]] in the body.
  - **Effect:** Provides 1d3 [[Sanity Armor]] (this does not stack with other Sanity Armor sources; it can stack only for targets with the [[Audience Pathway]]).

> **GM Note:** Other special item effects require approval by the GM.

> **GM Note:** Under special circumstances, you can refer to the [[Potions Professor]] list of medicines for making new medicines. However, the [[God of War Pathway]] is not a Sequence Pathway suitable for research, so the development of new medicines should be greatly restricted.

- **Imprint Form Variation:** You can craft a resistance imprint instead of a mark; it grants 10 points of resistance to the corresponding damage/condition type (holy, lightning, cold, or curse). This cannot be superimposed.

### God of War

- **Trigger:** Whenever you fall into [[Madness]].
- **Effect:** Temporarily consume 3 points of **Will Cap** to continue fighting in a normal state.
- **Limits:** This does not affect your **Will Defense**.
- **Failure Condition:** If your [[Sanity]] reaches a negative value, you immediately lose the will to fight and cannot continue fighting.
- **Recovery:** The lost Will Cap can be restored after an hour.
- **Status Interaction:** You no longer suffer negative effects from blindness, deafness, fear, anger, etc., including negative emotions bestowed by the [[Black Emperor]], and will not suffer impairments—although these negative states still exist (e.g., you are still theoretically blind or deaf), you can still act normally through rich combat experience.
- **Limits:** This does not affect [[Dreaming]]; you will be awakened as usual if you are dreamed.
- **Special:** If the enemy that triggers these effects is of a higher Sequence than you, or is an [[Audience Pathway]] Extraordinary of the same Sequence, you only suffer the enemy’s related Identification penalty; you do not lose actions or become unable to act.

- **Sequence 3 Update:** The lost upper limit of will is restored after half an hour.
