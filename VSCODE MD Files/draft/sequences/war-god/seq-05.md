# Sequence 5: Guardian

## Guardian

> **Lore:** It is rare for a Guardian to be hurt.

- When you enter a **Guardian State** and give up attacking, few beings below [[LINK LATER: High Sequence | type=term | hint=power tier]] can break your defense; your defense applies the same against all types of damage.
- When you attack, the corresponding defense is greatly reduced (still stronger than [[LINK LATER: Refined Full-Body Armor | type=item | hint=full-body armor]]).

You possess extraordinary abilities including [[LINK LATER: Sword of Dawn | type=ability | hint=Guardian ability]] and [[LINK LATER: Storm of Light | type=ability | hint=Guardian ability]], enabling you to:

- Deal damage to any type of monster.
- Avoid being confused by [[LINK LATER: Illusions | type=mechanic | hint=illusion effects]].
- Help companions within a certain range bear damage and protect them.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Continue to endure extreme pain from being slapped shoulder-to-shoulder. Ensure the pain is close to death but not fatal. Persevere, and drink the potion at the moment you can regain your ability to move by your own will.

> **GM Note:** Labeled “unofficial ceremony” in the source text.

### Promotion Effects

- Advancing to Guardian causes your senses to be “guarded” indiscriminately, causing you to lose pain, smell, touch, and eventually all awareness of the outside world.
- The loss progresses in this order:
  1. Pain
  2. Smell
  3. Touch
  4. Complete external perception (you become “like a stone”)
- Continuous pain is required to maintain this anchor point; otherwise you become fully “protected” as above.

## Extraordinary Characteristics

- **Appearance:** Fist-sized, heart-like, covered with holes, shining like the morning sun.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +2, Agility +1, Will +1.

### Wall of Protection

- **Cost:** 3 [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource]].
- **Use:** 1 [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]].
- **Effect:** Insert a giant sword in front of your body. Morning light emerges, erecting an unbreakable invisible wall to your left and right.
- The wall shares [[LINK LATER: Health | type=mechanic | hint=hit points]] with you: damage to the wall damages you. [[UNCLEAR: The text “Damage to the wall is equal to trying to hurt you, against your value” does not specify which statistic(s) are used to resolve attacks/damage against the wall.]]

The wall is used in one of the following ways:

1. **Guard Your Companions**
   - You place the giant sword in front of your body as a symbol.
   - While your companions are behind the sword, a 50-meter-long invisible wall blocks attacks that try to hit them.
   - **Special:**
     - Your companions cannot cross this wall.
     - You can move freely inside and outside the wall.

2. **Guardian Status**
   - If you protect yourself instead of companions, you can no longer perform any actions.
   - You gain:
     - +8 [[LINK LATER: External Damage Reduction | type=mechanic | hint=damage mitigation]].
     - +5 [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]].
   - A **Guardian Wall** isolates you from the inside and outside of the surrounding area.
   - **Special:** In **Guardian State**, even if [[LINK LATER: Armor of Dawn | type=item | hint=dawn-themed armor]] is broken through the defense, it is not damaged.

### Ignore Hallucinations

- **Effect:** As long as the source is not higher than “1 person” above you, their [[LINK LATER: Hallucination Abilities | type=mechanic | hint=hallucination effects]] are invalid against you by default. [[UNCLEAR: “Not higher than 1 person of you” is undefined (likely a level/Sequence comparison), so the exact threshold is ambiguous.]]
- This also applies to:
  - Extraordinary abilities of pleasing/deceiving.
  - The distortion of thinking by the [[LINK LATER: Black Emperor | type=pathway | hint=Pathway/authority that distorts thinking]].
- It does **not** include conspiratorial conspiracies (“low mystery Spend”). [[UNCLEAR: “Conspiratorial conspiracies (low mystery Spend)” is undefined and may refer to a separate mechanic or category.]]
