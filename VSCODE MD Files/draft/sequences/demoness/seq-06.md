# Sequence 6: Witch of Pleasure

> **Lore:** The “witch” is improved in all aspects—more beautiful, highly charming, and skilled at giving the opposite sex or the same sex unforgettable happiness in love. She can create strange silk threads like a spider and use them to tease enemies—but spider webs fear fire.

## Code of Play

- Inescapable, Irresistible Pleasure Is a Kind of Pain

## Advancement

### Main Materials

- A pair of eyes of a bewitching banshee
- A silk gland of an adult widow giant spider

### Auxiliary Materials

- 100 ml of pure water
- 5 drops of black mandala juice
- All the remaining hair of the glamorous banshee
- 10 grams of powder crushed by Fenepot flies
- 5 grams of real mummy ashes

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Strength** +1
- **Constitution** +1
- **Agility** +1
- **Inspiration** +1
- **Charisma** +2
- Biology and **Pleasing** skills increase by 1 level.
- Your mysticism can be quickly upgraded to erudition.
- For every 3 hours of pleasure you bring to a non-repeating intelligent creature, your **Pleasing** or Biology counts as 1 growth.
  - You choose to grow **Pleasing** or Biology.
  - Biology grows up to Proficiency.
  - **Pleasing** grows up to Learned.
  - Use **Pleasing** as the canonical term; all "pleasure/pleasant" mentions in this section refer to **Pleasing**.

### Web Creation

- **Cost:** 3 **spirituality points**
- **Use:** 1 **swift action**, once per round
- **Effect:** You extend your spirituality, creating an invisible cobweb that spreads across the room, satisfying the prerequisites for [[Touch of Pleasure]] and [[Hair Control]].
- **Source rule:** Although it spreads all over the room, all cobwebs are extended from your body; the cobwebs will be there wherever you are, and their source will be you.
- **Hair alternative:** If you are unable or inconvenient to make spider webs, you can consider using your own hair to use Touch of Pleasure and the ability to control silk hair.
  - Hair, unlike cobwebs, is not invisible, and taking damage can reach you.

- The webs you create obey the following characteristics:
  1. The spider web has 2d6 health points and 10 basic physical defense. It is manifested as spider silk that spreads over the entire area but is almost invisible. It is regarded as a single target, and it is scattered because it is invisible but sensitive.
  2. The range is not wide enough and the physical damage of a single target is ineffective against spider silk (such as pistols, fists, but not including cannons).
  3. The health of the silk cannot be superimposed, but you can reuse this ability to repair the silk.

- **Destroy the spider web:** The damage that can destroy it can only be fire, lightning, or an indiscriminate range attack sweeping across the field, destroying the invisible spider web. Mental damage is obviously meaningless to it.
- **Flame destruction:** Assuming the type of damage that destroys the spider web is flame, the flame will cause the spider web to be immediately regarded as incinerated no matter how much HP is left at the moment the flame appears.
  - When the flame appears, you must pass a **Difficulty Value** 20 Dexterity Identification; otherwise, you suffer fire damage equal to the remaining HP of the spider webs. [[Dexterity Identification]]

### Touch of Pleasure

- **Use:** 1 **swift action**, 1 time per round
- **Prerequisite:** You must first extend the web to use this ability; it is essentially manipulating the web and hair:
  1. If there is no spider web on the field, you can make the hair grow faster to cast it, which is regarded as spider web creation.
  2. Hair strands are visible compared to spider webs and cannot be immune to single-target physical damage. Hair that grows quickly also has 3d6 health points, but once it is ignited, it will usually burn yourself, which is difficult to avoid.
- There are four uses of this ability, and the four uses are incompatible. You can only choose one of the following benefits to take effect at the same time.
- Sequence 5: The number of uses is changed from 1 time in 1 round to 2 times in 1 round.
- All of the following benefits affect at most one target at a time.

#### Use 1: Induce joy to affect the enemy

- You choose a creature. The Charisma check is against its **Will Defense**; a success makes it enter a state of joy. [[Will Defense]]
- Charisma -4 penalty if the target is hostile to you, and -4 penalty if you don't match the other's sexual orientation.
- **Happy state:** flushed face, rapid heartbeat, fever at the tips of the ears, slight numbness in the body, blood rushing down, just like a cold. [[Happy state]]
- Effects while in the happy state:
  - All skill and attribute evaluations of the target are -2 disadvantageous.
  - In the happy state, 1 spellcasting/attack/movement, or 2 swift actions are continuously lost. [[Action loss (spellcasting/attack/movement; swift actions)]]
- Maintenance: The state of joy requires continuous confrontation every round to maintain it. If you switch the usage of the touch of joy midway, the state of joy will end, and the affected target will still have the aftertaste of flushing.

#### Use 2: Use silk hair to bind the enemy

- You choose a creature. Charisma checks counter its **Physical Defense**, ignore armor; a success puts it in a stasis state. [[Physical Defense]] [[Ignore armor]]
- **Stasis state:** The target is entangled with almost invisible thin threads. It cannot completely restrain the target, but can slow its speed and affect the target's movement.
  - The target's agility is temporarily -2, affecting movement and physical defense. [[Stasis state]]
- Breaking free:
  - Once entangled, the creature can break free by performing a **Difficulty Value** 15 strength test every time it takes action, or achieve a teleportation; otherwise, it cannot break free. [[Strength test]] [[Teleportation]]
  - Even if it breaks free, the Witch of Pleasure can try to entangle again.
- If the Witch of Pleasure falls into a state of dreaming, awe, or fear, the difficulty of the **binding Charisma check** is reduced to 10. [[Dreaming]] [[awe]] [[Fear]]
- Continuous use: This usage can be used continuously. If the binding Charisma check succeeds 2 times and the target does not break free halfway, it will be truly regarded as a bound state (like a cocoon), and it will be changed to a strength identification of difficulty 20 to break free. [[Bound State]]

#### Use 3: Use silk hair to move quickly

- Requires a spider web to be effective; long hair that needs to be temporarily extended is not as fast as a spider web that has spread over the entire area and can be pulled at any time.
- You let the silk pull you to move immediately in another direction you choose, within your movement power.
- This is equivalent to a flame jump, and you directly avoid a non-area attack aimed at your original direction. [[Flame jump]] [[Non-area attack]]

#### Use 4: Using silk hair to deflect vital strikes

- Usually replaced by fast movement; mostly used when the silk is burned and only long hair is left.
- When a target tries to hit you critically, you can raise your long hair suddenly and perform a **Difficulty Value** 20 agility test to let your hair hit the incoming attack and deflect your vital point that is about to be hit. [[Critical Hit]]
- If the deflection is successful:
  - Vital points will be randomly selected; the original target points will be excluded.
  - The remaining points will be randomly selected according to the point list rd6 of the key point special action. [[Key point special action]] [[rd6]]
  - When the result of the dice roll rd6 is 6, it means that the part that does not belong to the vital part has been hit, and a normal judgment is made.
- The form of the deflected vital strike must have a certain entity, such as bullets, air bombs, black flame bullets, ice guns, flame spears, and melee attacks.
- If what is deflected is a melee vital blow on a limb, then the agility test with a difficulty of 20 will be changed to 1 strength confrontation to succeed; otherwise, it will not be affected. [[Strength confrontation]]
- Different from special actions and body parry, this usage is superior because it only needs 1 swift action to achieve. [[Body parry]] [[Special actions]]

**Use silk hair to resist damage**

- You keep cobwebs or hair in front of you to protect against damage.
- Treat their remaining life as your extra life, and resist the damage you receive.
- The damage to be resisted must also have a certain entity (it can resist bullets), but light/lightning is obviously not among them. [[Light/lightning damage]]
- If you take fire damage, they are destroyed immediately, which in turn burns you back, the same as if you took fire damage from webs or hair.
- This defensive use is separate from the four **Touch of Pleasure** uses and can be used independently.

**Pleasant behavior in conjunction with spider silk and other things (Special)**

- If a creature is willing or forced to feel pleasure, the Witch of Pleasure can perform unspeakable actions with it, lasting anywhere from 10 minutes to 6 hours.
- For 1 hour: The creature regains 1 Sanity when it ends. [[Sanity]]
- More than 1 hour:
  - Creatures whose constitution value is less than 5 need to conduct a constitution appraisal with **Difficulty Value** 15:
    - Lose 1d6 life
    - Recover 1d3 sanity
    - If they survive, they will be addicted to pleasure
    - If they fail, they will die suddenly due to rapid heartbeat
- More than 3 hours:
  - Creatures with a constitution value of less than 5 need to make a constitution appraisal with a **Difficulty Value** 20:
    - If they fail, they will die suddenly
    - If they survive, they will fall into a state of exhaustion that lasts for 24 hours, losing 2d6 lives and 1 point of sanity
  - **Fatigued state:** In a fatigued state, you lose 1 spellcast/attack/move over time, or 2 swift actions. [[Fatigued state]]
  - A target with a constitution value of 5 but less than 8 requires a constitution appraisal of **Difficulty Value** 15:
    - A major failure will result in sudden death
    - A failure will result in a 24-hour exhaustion state, loss of 2d6 life, and loss of 1 sanity point
- Targets who have experienced it for more than three hours will inevitably fall into a joyful addiction.
  - Failure to perform similar behaviors every week will result in a 0/1 loss of sanity, which will be lifted if it continues for half a year.
- Warning: If you are pleasured for more than 3 hours while in the enchanted state of the witch, the enchanted state will last forever. Under normal circumstances, this will cause you to become the spiritual slave of the witch. [[Enchanted state]]
  1. If the witch does not conform to your sexual orientation, then the charm will not make you a slave, but it will still make you unwilling to be an enemy of her. Any behavior against her will lead to a state of charm. [[Charm (state)]]
  2. This enchanted state usually requires three years of not being in contact with the witch to get rid of, or undergoing mental treatment, or passing it on to a witch with higher charm. [[Mental treatment]]

> **GM Note:** Other moderators allow and reasonable use of spider silk.

### Primordial Cocoon

- **Cost:** 6 spirituality points
- **Use:** 1 **spellcasting action**
- **Effect:** You create a “silkworm cocoon” to protect yourself.
- **Special rule:** This is a synergy of your other abilities to some extent. Therefore, the fire thief cannot directly steal this ability from you, but can only steal one or two of its components at most. [[Fire thief]]

- The effects of Primordial Cocoon are as follows:
  1. **Black hair:** The outermost layer is curled black long hair.
     - Black hair has 3d6 health points.
     - The physical damage received is halved, and the fire damage is doubled.
     - The physical damage of a single target will not be deducted from the hair after suffering the half-half effect, but deduct ice crystal health.
  2. **Ice crystals:**
     - With 4d6+5 health points
     - Immune to cold damage
     - Normal fire damage (only gradually melted)
     - Physical damage penetrating black hair will be trapped in the middle of ice crystals.
  3. **Black Flame:**
     - There is no such thing as HP.
     - Creatures that touch Black Flame will immediately suffer damage equal to your Black Flame's long-range attack/2, and this damage can be offset by the damage that has passed through Black Flame's extraordinary ability. [[Black Flame long-range attack]]
     - Creatures want to pass the black flame: unless they pass the **Difficulty Value** 15 will test, otherwise they cannot pass. [[Will Test]]
     - Non-spiritual things can penetrate the black flame, such as giant swords or ordinary bullets for attack, and will not be offset by the black flame.
  4. **Action:**
     - At this stage, you can only do free actions inside the cocoon.
     - You can only concentrate on controlling the ability of the entire cocoon to continue to maintain and repair.
     - This is the only spell-casting action you can do.
     - Every time you take a casting action, you can restore the health of one of the components of the primordial cocoon (ice crystal or black hair, not both) at the expense of 3 spirituality points.
  5. **Defense:**
     - Your agility and dodge defenses still exist, but they are regarded as your armor at this moment.
     - They are judged by attacks that ignore armor capabilities.
     - But they do not suffer from armor that is ignored by other witches' touch of pleasure.
  6. **Under attack:**
     - Except for ranged mental damage (such as Longwei), mental puncture and frenzy cannot directly select your body as the target before breaking through the defense. [[Longwei]] [[Mental puncture]] [[id:alias-frenzy|Frenzy]]
     - A demigod ideologue can do this through the plagueseeds of the island of consciousness or otherwise through the abilities of the island of consciousness. [[Demigod ideologue]] [[Plagueseeds]] [[Island of consciousness]]
  7. **Decontamination:**
     - In this state, the black flames covering your whole body can decontaminate no more than one character on your body, and immediately remove all extraordinary effects on your body, including positive and negative effects. [[Extraordinary effects]]
     - This does not include symptoms of insanity and Sanity rolls that have occurred, as well as the 12-hour restoration of stolen abilities. [[Insanity]] [[Stolen abilities (12-hour restoration)]]
