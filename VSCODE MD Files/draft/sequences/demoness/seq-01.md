# Sequence 1: Witch of Apocalypse

## Doom Witch

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Proactively cause an [[Apocalypse]] that brings civilization to the brink of extinction, and take the [[Potion]] just as the disaster is officially beginning.
  - This is described as an unofficial ceremony.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Dexterity +2, Constitution +1, Strength +1, Charm +1.

### Doomsday

- **Effect:**
  - Your [[Disaster Ability]] spans the entire continent.
  - You can combine your original abilities to create new disasters.
  - In one [[Encounter]], you can:
    - Mix and superimpose three disasters, **or**
    - Make one disaster appear three times.
      - Example: Meteorites become a meteor shower, dealing triple damage.
      [[UNCLEAR: “appear three times” could mean three repetitions, three simultaneous instances, or another form of tripling; the example only clarifies “triple damage.”]]
- **Cost:**
  - Each [[Spell-Casting Action]] consumes 15 points of [[Spirituality]].

> **GM Note:** If the target is the entire continent, do not focus on a single instance of damage. This disaster appears across the entire continent, and almost everyone will be affected; people may be devastated, which may cause a [[Divine Drop]].
