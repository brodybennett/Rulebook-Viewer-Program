text: 'Effect: Your [[Disaster Ability]] spans the entire continent. You can combine
  your original abilities to create new disasters. In one Encounter, you can: Mix
  and superimpose three disasters, or Make one disaster appear three times in the
  same encounter (resolve as three instances; for damage, treat it as triple damage).

- **Effect:**
  - Your [[Disaster Ability]] spans the entire continent.
  - You can combine your original abilities to create new disasters.
  - In one Encounter, you can:
    - Mix and superimpose three disasters, **or**
    - Make one disaster appear three times in the same encounter (resolve as three instances; for damage, treat it as triple damage).
      - Example: Meteorites become a meteor shower, dealing triple damage.
- **Cost:**
  - Each Casting Action consumes 15 points of [[Spirituality]].
