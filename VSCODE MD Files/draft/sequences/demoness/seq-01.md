  - You can combine your original abilities to create new disasters.
  - In one [[LINK LATER: Encounter | type=term | hint=scene/encounter timing unit]], you can:
    - Mix and superimpose three disasters, **or**
    - Make one disaster appear three times.
      - Example: Meteorites become a meteor shower, dealing triple damage.
      [[UNCLEAR: “appear three times” could mean three repetitions, three simultaneous instances, or another form of tripling; the example only clarifies “triple damage.”]]
