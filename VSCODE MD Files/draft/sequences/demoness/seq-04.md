### Man-Made Disasters

```yaml ability
id: demoness-seq-04-man-made-disasters
name: Man-Made Disasters
pathway: demoness
sequence: 4
type: active
action: cast
cost: {}
roll: null
opposed_by: none
range: Your **Blight Aura** [[Blight Aura]] is now wide enough to cover a small town,
  and can spread wider under certain conditions by exploiting existing potential hazards.
target: designated target(s)
duration: instant
scaling: []
tags:

text: 'Effect: Your ability to spread disease and create disasters is enhanced. Targeting
  and range: Your Blight Aura [[Blight Aura]] is now wide enough to cover a small
  town, and can spread wider under certain conditions by exploiting existing potential
  hazards. Process (hazard amplification): You must explore relevant real-world/setting
  events that have already occurred and discover potential man-made disasters that
  are harbingers and exploitable; you can amplify them. Example: For smog and weather
  pollution, with sufficient preparation you can intervene in one source of the problem
  once, and immediately amplify it through 8-point spiritual ritual magic [[Spiritual
  Ritual Magic]]. Smog example...'
```




- **Effect:** Your ability to spread disease and create disasters is enhanced.
- **Targeting and range:** Your **Blight Aura** [[Blight Aura]] is now wide enough to cover a small town, and can spread wider under certain conditions by exploiting existing potential hazards.
- **Process (hazard amplification):**
- You must explore relevant real-world/setting events that have already occurred and discover potential man-made disasters that are harbingers and exploitable; you can amplify them.  
  - Example: For smog and weather pollution, with sufficient preparation you can intervene in one source of the problem once, and immediately amplify it through **8-point spiritual ritual magic** [[Spiritual Ritual Magic]].
- **Smog example (plague-like effect):**
  - Passing through the smog has an effect similar to a very strong plague.
  - People infected by this magnified disaster plague enter **Infection Level 2** from the beginning. [[Infection Level]]
- Doctor care requires the **doctor** to have **Physical** level 20+ for it to not be spread. [[Physical]]
- Infected people below **Sequence 8** directly enter **Infection Level 1** unless they have directly encountered you; direct exposure starts at **Infection Level 2**.
  - This can almost instantly take the life of a person with poor constitution.
- Each round will gradually increase the target’s charm level against you, as long as exposure is via the haze as the medium of transmission; this confrontation is without exception.
  - During this process, your spreadable range is greatly enhanced according to the spread of the smog. If not stopped, its range will be at least half of [[Backlund]].
- **Damage (infection):** Poison damage increases from **1d6 + infection level damage** to **2d4 + infection level damage**.
- **Other pollution disasters:** In addition to plague effects, you can cause other pollution disasters according to the specific situation, including but not limited to:
  - Floods caused by man-made causes
  - Soil erosion, desertification, species resource depletion
  - Greenhouse effect, sandstorms, climate anomalies, ozone layer destruction
  - Locust plague, drought
- **Disaster as transmission medium:**
  - Each disaster above can be used as the transmission medium of your **Blight Aura** (also referred to here as **Plague Halo**) [[Blight Aura]] [[Plague Halo]].
  - Sandstorms sweeping across are regarded as the scope of your plague halo.
  - Locust plagues can be identified as plagues as long as locusts touch them, causing toxin effects.
- **Limits (creating disasters):**
  - You need a clear enough sign that has been regarded as a potential hazard and has caused certain vigilance and effects (example: Backlund’s industrial smog problem).
  - You must personally participate in these events to touch their source and make certain preparations to amplify them.
  - If conditions are right, they can be vectors for the spread of your plague.
- **Progression:** This ability will be substantially improved in [[id:alias-sequence-2|Sequence 2]].

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.


### Mirror Illusion

```yaml ability
id: demoness-seq-04-mirror-illusion
name: Mirror Illusion
pathway: demoness
sequence: 4
type: active
action: free
cost:
  spirituality: 6
roll: null
opposed_by: none
range: You create an extremely realistic illusion in a place where a mirror can reflect
  it.
target: designated target(s)
duration: instant
scaling: []
tags:
- ritual
text: 'Use: As a free action, once per turn. Cost: 3 spirituality points. [[Spirituality]]
  Targeting and range: You create an extremely realistic illusion in a place where
  a mirror can reflect it. Effect: The premise is that the thing under illusion really
  exists here, so it can be reflected. You can create illusions of: Yourself Items
  in your possession (which can be given to others)'
```




- **Use:** As a free action, once per turn.
- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points. [[Spirituality]]
- **Targeting and range:** You create an extremely realistic illusion in a place where a mirror can reflect it.
- **Effect:**
  - The premise is that the thing under illusion really exists here, so it can be “reflected.”
  - You can create illusions of:
    - Yourself
    - Items in your possession (which can be given to others)
    - An enemy’s own image
- You can even “teleport” your image remotely this way, as if you were there in person; the remote image can also deliver your voice and abilities there.
- **Opposition:** Charisma (CHA) check against Will defense. [[Charisma (CHA) Check]] Willpower Defense
- **Disbelieving the illusion:**
  - Only when the enemy senses something clearly amiss are they allowed to discover the truth with a Scout or Intuition (INT) check of **20 + your Pleasing stat**. [[Scout]] Intuition [[Pleasing]]
- If the **target** is in a mirrored environment, the illusion will be extremely real and indistinguishable.
- **Additional (Sequence 4):** When digestibility reaches **20**, you can also directly transmit power through the mirror. [[Digestibility]]

- **Limits:** As described in this section's prose.
