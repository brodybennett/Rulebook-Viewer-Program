# Witch Pathway: Sequence 5

## Witch of Sickness

> **Lore:** Also known as “Ms. Disease,” she excels at creating disease, destroying beauty, and reaping pain.

### Illness

- **Effect:** Covering nearly 50 meters, organisms within this range will gradually be infected, and the degree will become more and more serious.
  - At the beginning, it may be just skin allergies, cold and fever.
  - After 20 or 30 seconds, it may turn to severe pneumonia and other diseases.
  - Myocardial infarction and cerebral infarction will occur at any time after two or three minutes pass.

[[UNCLEAR: The section presents multiple time-to-severity descriptions (Illness overview vs. Infection Level 5 “three minutes” clause) without explicitly stating how they align mechanically.]]

## Advancement

### Acting

- **Acting rules:** Destroy the beauty that the other party wants to protect, and let them suffer in extreme mental pain.

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual (unofficial):** Pursue and practice this ultimate love, taking the potion at the moment of greatest love.

> **GM Note:** The RAW describes an intense “promotion ordeal” centered on extreme pain and love, framed as fitting the Witch Path’s transformation themes. This text is narrative guidance and does not add numeric modifiers.

- **Effect (narrative):** When promoted to the [[Witch of Pain]], the Extraordinary will suffer extreme pain shaped by past experience, “engraved on your heart,” tearing away self-maintained “fig leafs,” exposing and destroying the twisted heart again and again. Love is described as the “optimal solution” for resisting this power, and the ritual is described as “extremely distorted” yet “romantic.”
- **Post-promotion acting (narrative):** The RAW notes that after promotion, the witch wants to make others full of pain, and a “faster performance” has to make herself feel the pain again, ending in rejection/tearing/farewell.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** strength +1, constitution +1, agility +1, inspiration +1, will +1, charisma +1
- **Skill advancement notes:**
  - your [[Mysticism]] can be quickly promoted to master
  - the skills involved in Sequence 9/8 can be promoted to [[Erudition]]
  - [[Pleasing]] can be promoted to [[Master]]

### Plague Aura

- **Cost:** 1 **Swift Action** to turn it on or off.
- **Use:** After it is turned on:
  - you can specify which part of the area within the range will start to have the disease
  - you can specify the direction in which the disease spreads
  - things such as wind and insects can carry the disease to farther places
- **Targeting and range:**
  - Flesh creatures within 50 meters of you will begin to be infected with disease.
  - **Warning:** The plague itself does not depend on your will. You can only decide the direction of the plague. Therefore, all creatures within 5 meters of the area you designate will be regarded as the target of the plague. There is no distinction between the enemy and the enemy except you. You can keep a distance from the enemy to avoid.
- **Effect (per turn):**
  - ① Every time it is your turn to act, you can use 1 [[Mystic Identification]] against the [[Physical Defense]] of the creature within the range of the disease you specify.
    - If the identification is successful:
      - it will cause 1d6 [[Poison Damage]]
      - the degree of infection will be increased by 1 level
    - (If a creature’s [[Damage Reduction]] resists all poison damage, the infection level does not increase.)
- **Undead exception:**
  - ② Undead creatures with entities are generally unable to be affected by the disease, but the witch’s disease ability is quite strange.
  - When infected to a certain stage, the disease can affect the actions of the muscles.
    - This undead creature will lose one action at the infection level of 3.
    - It will lose two actions at the infection level of 5.
    - It is not affected by the effects of other diseases.
- **Scaling with potion digestion:**
  - For every 5 points in the progress of [[Potion Digestion]]: the range of the aura increases by 10 meters.
  - [[Potion Completely Digested]]: Increased to 100m range.

#### Effects of epidemics of different infection levels

1) **① Mild Infection**
   - **Rules:** It is considered to be at a disadvantage, and the person who attacks the infected person is considered to have an advantage, and the advantages/disadvantages cannot be superimposed.
   - **Symptoms:** Mild skin allergy symptoms will appear at this level of infection, but not to the extent that they will be noticed unless carefully checked.

2) **② Mild infection**
   - **Rules:** Only one swift action can be performed per round, and the casting action, attack action, or moving action can be converted into a swift action.
   - **Symptoms:** The body temperature of the infected person will rise, with a slight fever, and something is wrong with the inspiration identification of Difficulty Value 20.
     - (If the infected person has been teased by the touch of pleasure before, the increase in body temperature will be confused because of the pleasure, and it is impossible to judge whether the increase in body temperature is due to pleasure or disease. It can only be detected by changing the Difficulty Value to 25.)

3) **③ Moderate infection**
   - **Rules:** Every time you perform a spellcasting/attacking action, or swiftness/freedom involving language, you need to go through a Difficulty Value 15 will or a Difficulty Value 20 physique appraisal, otherwise you will cough uncontrollably, the spellcasting/attack will be interrupted, and the action will still be wasted.
   - **Symptoms:** The infected person will immediately notice that they have the desire to cough or have coughed immediately after the first will or physical examination.

4) **④ Severe infection**
   - **Rules:** Every time a creature caught in a severe infection performs a spellcasting or attacking action, it needs a Difficulty Value 20 will test or a Difficulty Value 25 constitution test, otherwise it is equivalent to an infection level 3 situation.
     - **Major failure of Will/Constitution:** Coughing up blood, loss of 1d6 [[Hit Points]].
   - **Symptoms:** The cold symptoms of the infected person have deteriorated into severe pneumonia.

5) **⑤ Fatal infection**
   - **Rules:**
     - Movement actions also require will or constitution identification, otherwise they will cough until they cannot support, curl up and fall to the ground in pain.
     - If they still do not receive first aid or escape from the range of the disease aura after three minutes, they will lose 3d6 HP per round.
     - **Will/Physical Failure:** Sudden cerebral infarction and myocardial infarction, no matter how much life is left, is considered to be in a state of [[Near Death]].
   - **Symptoms:** In this state, the infected person has a high fever of 40 degrees, and pneumonia and myocardial infarction are in a life-threatening state.

#### Curing disease

- A successful [[Medical Check]] reduces the infection level by one.
  - usually takes 1d3 hours
  - can only be done once per day
- ① Even if you escape the aura of plague, you will still be subject to the plague attack test of the [[Witch of Pain]] every 24 hours, causing 1d6 poison damage, and thus deepening the infection level, until someone removes all your infection levels.
- ② If someone has taken care of the infected person for 12 hours, then a physical fitness appraisal with a Difficulty Value of 20 is required, otherwise the infection will be deepened at level 1.
  - If you take good protection, it will only have a Difficulty Value of 5.
  - Unless you fail, you will usually not be infected.

### Frost Control

- **Cost:** consumes 4 [[Spirituality]].
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**; emits an invisible scream; a blue illusory aura gushes out from your body.
- **Effect:**
  - wherever it goes, frost condenses
  - the world will not only condense ice, but also cover a layer of soft white snow, causing the air to float beautiful dreamy snowflakes
  - after the spell is cast, an area up to 50 meters away is considered cold

#### Cold environment

- **Cold environment:** All creatures that do not have [[Cold Resistance]] have:
  - -2 skill and attribute appraisal
  - slow thinking, and frozen actions
  - the agility and dodge part of the physical defense will last -2
  - the movement power will be halved
  - (these effects last) until a way to resist the cold environment is found.
- **Stacking rules:**
  - The effect of the cold environment can be superimposed with the effect of the [[Ice Gun]].
  - It cannot be superimposed with other cold environments.
  - The cold environment will be covered by a stronger cold environment.
