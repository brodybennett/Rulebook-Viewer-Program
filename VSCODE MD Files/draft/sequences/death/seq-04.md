# Sequence 4: Undying

- You die once every 60 years, resurrect once, and forget most of your past memories; these memories must be slowly retrieved afterward, as if starting a new life.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The opening summary says “resurrect once,” but the Immortality rules below describe repeating 60-year death/resurrection cycles.]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

**Ritual:** Create the appearance of a death.

- Impress “imminent death” in the presence of a sufficiently significant individual, or multiple others.
- After your “death,” be exorcised and buried in the correct form.
- Finally, be deemed dead.
- Some people dig up the coffin where you were buried again; after the other party sees the empty coffin and the reality or evidence of your resurrection, they take a potion amid their weird emotions. (Unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Shuttle in the Spirit World

- **Cost:** 1 **Casting Action** [[Casting Action]]
- **Use:** Travel via the connection and power between the Underworld [[Underworld]] and the Spirit World [[Spirit World]], producing a travel effect similar to the Apprentice Pathway [[Apprentice Pathway]].
- **Effect:**
  - When you are about to shuttle from the Spirit World or emerge from the Spirit World, the surrounding colors become more vivid (reds redder, blues bluer; reds and yellows show a bit of brown), as if the environment’s color saturation increases.
  - You teleport a short or long distance and gain the benefits below:
    - If you prepare for the Spirit World shuttle in advance, or have completed this casting action, then **unless it is a Great Success** [[Great Success]], any attack aimed at you that has a distance limit, or cannot locate your position, automatically misses until you reach the destination.
    - The Death Pathway [[Death Pathway]] version of Spirit World shuttle cannot avoid blows from **Free Actions** [[Free Action]]; blows from Free Actions resolve as usual.
    - You can move to any place you want at will.
  - Before or after teleportation, you can clearly feel the surroundings of the teleportation location.
  - If you have not been there, you can make a successful **Pilotage Appraisal** [[Pilotage Appraisal]] to determine the location.
- **Limits:**
  - This does not achieve the same “frenzied flash” effect as the Apprentice Pathway, even if you use Mythic Form [[Mythic Form]] instead of Astral Travel [[Astral Travel]] as a Free Action.

> **GM Note:** If you use this ability for attack avoidance, you usually announce in advance that you will use it after performing a certain action (similar to the Diviner Pathway’s [[Diviner Pathway]] “Flame Jump” [[Flame Jump]]), which can usually avoid most feedback for your action.

### Necrotic Seal

- **Use:** Use the power of the Underworld [[Underworld]] to suppress the negative effects of Extraordinary Items [[Extraordinary Item]], or permanently half-seal their negative effects.
- **Cost (temporary):** 8 points of **Spirituality** [[Spirituality]]
- **Activation (temporary):** **Free Action** [[Free Action]]
- **Effect (temporary):** Suppress all negative effects of an item for 1d2 hours.
- **Handling requirement:** Only in your hands, the negative effects of the sealed item are no longer as serious:
  - Negative effects that would have an immediate reaction either weaken, or take a certain amount of time to produce specific effects.
  - Example: a sealed item that would have an obvious impact within 1 hour takes two hours to do so.
- **Cost (permanent):** Spend an additional 8 points of Spirituality to make this seal last forever, including when giving the item to others. This uses the power of the Underworld.
- **Effect (permanent):** This cannot make an item permanently immune to negative effects, but it can effectively reduce its harm.
  - Example: if an item would require eating a living person every day, after being sealed it only produces an effect that requires eating a living person after using its ability once (it is not necessary to kill a living person every day regardless of whether the item is used).
- **Additional changes (as a standard):**
  - Damage caused by the item is usually halved.
  - Range is halved.
  - The time required to try to cause negative effects is longer.
  - The GM determines specifics according to this standard.
- **Counterplay / reversal:**
  - This seal is essentially achieved by establishing a connection between extraordinary items and the Underworld. If someone deliberately dispels this “breath,” the negative-effect seal returns to its original state.
  - Enemies cannot do this via any combat-level dispelling effect; at minimum, the item must fall into the enemy’s hands and a separate ritual of dispersal must be performed. [[Ritual of Dispersal]]
  - Dispersion can also be sealed again.

### Immortality

- **Effect:** When you are promoted, you use your current appearance as the initial benchmark and die every 60 years.
  - During each 60-year period, you still gradually age.
  - At 60 years, you must find a safe place to die; you then lose all memories, resurrect, return to the apparent age you were when you took the undead potion, and continue the cycle.
- **Sequence 3 change:** At Sequence 3 [[id:alias-sequence-3|Sequence 3]], you no longer need to reincarnate every 60 years: you remain immortal, and your apparent age is always what it was when you took the undead potion.

### Underworld Executive Power

- **Effect:**
  - Your **Necromancy** [[Necromancy]] damage is increased by 1d6.
  - The cost is reduced to 4 spirit.  
    [[UNCLEAR: The resource name varies between “Spirituality” (spent as points) and “spirit” (used as a cost).]]
  - Necromancy use changes from 1 time per round to twice per round.
