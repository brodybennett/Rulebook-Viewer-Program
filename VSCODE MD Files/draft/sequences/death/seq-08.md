# Sequence 8: Gravedigger

## Gravedigger

- Your body is stronger, your spirit vision is stronger, your skills are more agile, and you can initially communicate with a small number of nearby spirits.
- **Eyes of Death** lets you overlook an enemy “from a higher level” to find key weaknesses, especially against unfamiliar undead and spirit creatures.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +2, Agility (DEX) +1, Intuition (INT) +1
- Your knowledge of the dead can be learned to be erudite.

### Training and Learning Benefits

1. Fighting, shooting, throwing, and their subdivision skills are included in your quick learning scope. You need to receive at least 2 hours of real and effective related guidance to improve a level. You can only learn once a day to digest Knowledge.
2. From training to proficiency, you must learn **2 times**; the maximum remains **Proficient**.
3. Character cards that have not just been promoted can use twice the Intuition (INT) brought by potions to add growth skills.

### Eyes of Death

- **Cost:** 5 [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** As a **Full-Round Action** [[Full-Round Action]], choose 1 **undead creature** in front of you.
  - If the execution completes and is not interrupted, the effect applies.
- **Effect:**
  - You personally benefit from a **Great Success** on all attacks against the chosen undead creature.
  - Regardless of whether the undead creature you choose has ever been known to you, as long as the Eyes of Death scrutiny is complete, your attacks against it gain the bonus of [[Knowledge of the Dead]].
- **Great Success (damage rule):**
  - Your damage is guaranteed, and it must cause more than half of the maximum theoretical damage, rounded up.
  - If the value of the rolled damage is lower than half of the maximum theoretical damage, it will be changed to half of the damage regardless of the [[Attack Identification]] result.
- **Valid targets (what counts as undead):**
  - The out-of-control is also regarded as a kind of undead creature (its essence has died) and can be examined with Eyes of Death. [[Out-of-Control]]
  - This includes products considered to have “died of essence,” such as secret puppets. [[Secret Puppets]]
- **Special:**
  - Enjoying the benefits of Great Success does **not** mean your attack must hit. You still need to conduct attack identification; only when you hit the target can you enjoy the guaranteed-damage benefit.

> **Lore:** Eyes of Death seems able to “enter the spiritual world and the kingdom of the dead,” overlooking enemies to find an important node.

### Communicating with the Dead

- **Cost:** 3 [[Spirituality]]
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action** Casting Action
- **Effect:** You summon a **spirit body** and let it perform 1 action instead of you.
- **Limits:**
  - For the time being, you can only summon the following spirits:
    - **Shadow**
      - 15 Vitality
      - 15 [[Physical Defense]] (Agility (DEX) and Dodge 5)
      - 10 Willpower Defense
      - 5 points of [[Cold Resistance]]
      - Attack actions cause 1d6 cold damage
      - No more abilities, but can perform special actions such as grapple [[Grapple]]
      - For ease of calculation, Shadow’s skill and ability bonuses depend on your Intuition (INT), or use a +5 check value for processing.
  - Each Casting Action can summon a spirit body. However, your current ability cannot summon them in advance; you can only temporarily issue preliminary instructions to surrounding spirits.
  - After each spirit performs an action, it will disappear.
- **Special:**
  - For continuous actions such as grapple, the spirit will continue to execute until the target breaks free.
  - You and the spirit do not have any deeper communication and sensory sharing.
  - Generally speaking, any area can call this preliminary spirit body.

### Quick Dodge

- **Effect:** You can dodge firearms.
1. When facing guns, you fully retain the agility and dodge in [[Physical Defense]], which does not include light and lightning. [[light and lightning]]
2. When you face an attack that is slower than a gun, you can dodge more quickly, and you get an extra level of dodge. [[Dodge level]]
- **Special:** This is the effect brought by 1 potion and cannot be stolen or recorded. [[Potions]]
