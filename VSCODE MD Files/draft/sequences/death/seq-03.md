# Sequence 3: Ferryman

> **GM Note:** This section is marked “for reference only” and includes “unofficial” ritual text. Treat it accordingly.

## Ferryman

- Creatures that look at you die directly; even creatures with divinity suffer heavy damage.
- Even without direct line-of-sight contact, a target included in your eyes slowly withers, as if crossing the river of death inch by inch.
- Most attacks are ineffective against you.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Guide wandering spirits to the underworld; bury tens of thousands of corpses and souls; after fulfilling an angel’s last wish, lead the angel’s remaining spirits to the underworld to rest in peace.
  - (Marked “unofficial ceremony” in RAW.)

- **Substitute Ritual:** Create an upside-down mausoleum at the location of the [[River of Eternal Darkness]]. After entering the mausoleum:
  - Connect yourself with the [[River of Eternal Darkness]].
  - Step into the [[River of Eternal Darkness]] to become part of the [[River Styx]].
  - Flow up to the end of the river.
  - Leave an immediate imprint on the [[River of Darkness]].
  - (Marked “unofficial ritual” and “reference to some of the original incomplete rituals” in RAW.)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +1, Strength +1, Dexterity +1, Inspiration +1; choose 1 skill to increase 1 level.

### Ferryman

- **Effect:**
  - You have become the real dead.
  - Your malice, thoughts, and behavior tendencies are hidden; you become a dead person without thoughts.
  - No one can read your thoughts except a Beyonder of the [[Audience Pathway]] at the same Sequence as you.
  - The malicious perception of the [[Abyss Pathway]] is no longer effective against you.

- **Defenses and damage interactions:**
  - Most attacks except **holy attacks** are no longer effective against you.
  - You have no physical vitals.
  - **Physical damage:** invalid.
  - **Fire damage:** halved.
  - **Mind and spirit strike damage:** halved.
  - **Cold damage:** invalid.
  - **Lightning damage:** normal.
  - **Curses:** no effect.
  - **Curse damage:** no effect.
  - **Sanity damage:** halved.
    - Maximum pressure is 1.
    - Promotion sanity loss cannot be saved.

- **Higher-Sequence attacker rule:**
  - If the attacker is 1 Sequence higher than you: except for damage types you are immune to, their attacks can have normal effects.

- **Special (damage sharing):**
  - Damage sharing from the [[Secret Puppet]] with the same personality and different Pathways is still valid for you.
  - However, damage applied to you via damage sharing is unilaterally halved; the puppet still receives the full damage.
  - This is not limited to curse damage from sharing; all types of shared damage are unilaterally halved.
  - If the [[xenomorph]] is 1 level higher than you, you take full shared damage.

### River of Eternal Darkness

- **Effect:** A target you put into your eyes slowly withers, like crossing the river of death inch by inch.

- **Use:** As a **free action**, open this effect.

- **Targeting and range:**
  - **Direct gaze:** Non-undead creatures that meet your gaze.
  - **Peripheral vision:** If the target is not looking at you, but is only seen out of your peripheral vision, and remains within your sight.

- **Damage (direct gaze):**
  - The target immediately suffers 6d10+10 damage.
  - This 6d10+10 damage can only be triggered once per encounter.
  - The damage is reduced by 10 for each Sequence higher than you.

- **Damage (peripheral vision):**
  - The target suffers 1d10 damage each round while within your sight.
  - There is no limit to the number of times the damage can be lost continuously in each round.
  - [[UNCLEAR: “no limit to the number of times the damage can be lost continuously in each round” is unclear about whether/how damage repeats within a single round.]]

- **Damage type and resistance:**
  - This is **curse damage**, but it ignores the effects of [[Curse Resistance]] and [[Curse Reduction]].

- **Clones and indirect viewing:**
  - Even through a clone like [[Secret Puppet]], if the Secret Puppet owner dares to look directly at you, they suffer half of the damage of looking at you.
  - The clone of the [[Mistake Pathway]] and the [[Audience Pathway]] will not affect the main body because they are very independent.

- **Sequence 2 reference (RAW text):**
  - **Sequence 2:** There is no need to look at each other. Except for the target of the same personality, all creatures you see suffer the damage of the river of death and die almost immediately.
  - After death, they are directly converted into undead creatures controlled by you, and slaves at all your command.
  - Also, even targets of the same rank as you still take 2d10+5 hits per round as long as they are within your line of sight.

- **Extra:**
  - **Use:** Consume a **casting action**.
  - **Cost:** 3 [[Spirituality]].
  - **Effect:** Endow the Ferryman “no longer thinking” property to one or more designated targets.
    - Halve their physical damage.
    - Make them immune to vital blows.
    - Halve the damage of curses.
    - Otherwise as usual: they are treated as an undead creature; they decay, rot, wither, die, and lose the sense of freshness for 24 hours.

### The Language of the Dead

- **Effect:** The language of the dead is not only a language the living cannot understand; it also carries screams and roars from the depths of the underworld as a **mental attack**.

- **Use:** As a **casting action**, once per encounter.

- **Targeting and range:** Anyone who hears your dead man’s language.

- **Damage:**
  - Those who hear it suffer 1d4/1d6+1 Sanity hits.
  - [[UNCLEAR: “1d4/1d6+1” does not specify when to use 1d4 vs 1d6, or how this expression is determined.]]

- **Interaction with Words of the Dead / rebuke:**
  - It can be released at the same time as the previous [[Words of the Dead]] effect.
  - If released at the same time, the effect of rebuke and negotiation against the attack of its [[Will Defense]] can allow the above sanity appraisal to be used for the easy-to-crazy effect of the [[Audience Pathway]].
  - [[UNCLEAR: The exact procedure linking “rebuke and negotiation” vs Will defense to the “easy-to-crazy effect” is unclear in RAW.]]

- **RAW clarification text (kept, condensed without changing mechanics):**
  - The 1d4+1/1d6+1 sanity check only uses rd20 against your existing sanity, and the rd20 was not a big success.
  - If you used the rebuke effect against the enemy’s Will defense, the big success of the rebuke effect’s diplomacy check equals the great success of this sanity test.
  - Throwing 20 for the scolding value makes the sanity test full.
  - For the Audience, values of 18, 19, and 20 all make their sanity test full.

- **Extra:**
  - **Use:** As a **full-round action**, directly transform a creature into your slave.
  - **Effect:** The creature is regarded as an undead creature.
  - **Time/limits:**
    - It takes 3 minutes for a Beyonder who is not a demigod or lower in the [[Death Pathway]].
    - An undead creature of your strength is only a full-round action.
    - The converted creature must be weaker than you.
    - You cannot directly convert a demigod.
    - [[UNCLEAR: The clause “not a demigod or lower in the Death Path” is unclear about which targets require 3 minutes.]]

  - **Special case (RAW text):**
    - If a creature grants you undead qualities, and is one person lower than you, this requires two of your -4 [[Words of the Dead check]] against their Will defense.
    - This does not take three minutes; it is achieved with a full-round action, for as long as they are undead.
    - [[UNCLEAR: “one person lower,” “two of your -4 Words of the Dead check,” and duration/maintenance conditions are unclear in RAW.]]
