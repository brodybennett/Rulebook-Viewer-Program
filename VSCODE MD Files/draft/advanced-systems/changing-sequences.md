# Chapter 16: Explanation Notes on Switching Sequences

> GM Note: This chapter was left by someone other than the original rulebook author.

When you advance to Sequence 5, under normal circumstances you can begin considering switching to an adjacent Pathway. That is, you can stop continuing along your current Sequence Pathway and instead start from Sequence 4 on a different Pathway. [[Switching Pathways]]

> Lore: Because the essence of Beyonder power is Beyonder Characteristics, and Beyonder Characteristics are conserved and indestructible (they do not increase out of nowhere, nor decrease out of nowhere), switching Pathways must follow the conversion rules below. [[Beyonder Characteristic]]

## Conversion Rules

### Rule 1: Retain original abilities, but stop original advancement

**Core rule:** After switching Pathways, your original Sequence abilities are retained, but you can no longer gain further Sequence advancement on that original Pathway.

**Effect:** You keep the abilities you already had from your original Pathway, but you cannot advance further on that original Pathway. [[Original Pathway abilities]]

**Example:** If a Reader at Sequence 5 switches to the Spectator Pathway at Sequence 4, assume the Sequence 4 potion of the Spectator Pathway contains the Beyonder Characteristics corresponding to Sequence 9-5 of the Spectator Pathway. After advancing, this Reader at Sequence 5 becomes a Spectator Pathway Sequence 4 demigod and gains the full set of abilities of a Sequence 4 demigod. [[Demigod]]

If the advancement potion does not include the Sequence 9-5 characteristics, then with high probability they can only gain a small portion of the low-Sequence Spectator Beyonder abilities that serve as prerequisites for Sequence 4. For example, to "manipulate the mind" they must have "psychological guidance." Or they may gain the complete ability but with obviously insufficient strength, because Beyonder abilities gradually strengthen as Sequence increases; if you do not have the corresponding characteristic, then even if you have the corresponding ability, it can only remain at the lowest, unenhanced level, unless they later drink those potions again. At that time, this Beyonder who has already successfully switched Pathways is treated as a Spectator Pathway Beyonder and may drink low-Sequence potions of the Spectator Pathway. [[Potion]]

**Potion compatibility:** All potions are only compatible upward; they cannot be taken at the same level or downward, unless you have already switched to that Pathway. Your current Pathway is determined by the Pathway of the most recent potion you drank.

**Example:** In this case, they can re-drink the already-consumed Sequence 9-5 Reader potions, but cannot drink a same-level Sequence 4 Reader potion, unless it is a Sequence 3 Reader potion.

If this Reader continues advancing afterward, reaching Sequence 2 while still on the Spectator Pathway (without switching back to Reader midway), then their Reader abilities will remain at the Sequence 5 tier. No new abilities appear, but at the two Rank qualitative-change nodes of Sequence 4 and Sequence 2 (a Sequence 4 demigod, a Sequence 2 angel), the increase of divine Rank can allow the existing Sequence 5 Reader abilities to receive two steps of enhancement upward: the Sequence 4 enhancement and the Sequence 2 enhancement. [[Angel]]

**Premise:** The corresponding ability must provide enough next-Sequence enhancement to trigger a qualitative change; only then can you achieve the effect of "no new abilities appear, but you can try to make earlier abilities stronger." A special marker such as "Sequence x:" or "--Sequence x:" appears beneath the ability. If it is an ability that is separately categorized in the next Sequence, even if it is based on an earlier ability, it should not be treated as receiving this kind of enhancement. At most, in extremely special cases it might draw out a part of it, but this obviously requires some roundabout methods, cannot last long, and the effect is usually halved.

> GM Note: Enhancing existing abilities through divinity is presented here as an optional rule; the original work does not describe this in detail.

However, normally speaking, even if no qualitative change appears, low-Sequence abilities are still continuously getting stronger.

**Example:** Between a Sequence 5 Seer and a Sequence 7 Magician, setting aside quantity, in terms of effect the former's illusion abilities and paper substitute abilities will be better than the latter's.

This does not mean that the Rank increase from not switching Pathways will definitely produce a better effect than this, or that in "switching Pathways" you get +1 while "not switching" gives a +2 divinity change. However, if you compare a "+1 enhancement from switching Pathways" against a "+1 complete-ability Beyonder who did not switch Pathways," then assuming they are contesting the same kind of ability and with no other factors involved, the former will still be inferior to the latter in the pure degree of ability.

> GM Note: Those willing to simply go all the way down a single Pathway will, in practice, gain considerable advantages because of it: there is less to consider, and their mental state will also be healthier.

### Rule 2: Ability mutation after switching

**Core rule:** After switching Pathways, your original abilities and your current abilities will combine, producing certain mutations.

This is a very open-ended proposition. Examples:

- If a Darkness Pathway Sequence 5 switches to the Death Pathway Sequence 4, then the abilities of the two Pathways will mix. For instance, when entering dreams, it will not only have the "enter dream" effect; the person drawn into the dream will also gradually, unknowingly, die within the dream.
- If a Sequence 4 Seer switches to a Sequence 3 Apprentice, then their "Flame Jump" might become something that can jump out from whichever door it chooses, or jump out from whichever body of water it chooses.

This is a change direction with a very high degree of freedom. The specific mutation should be discussed between you and your GM, but the content should not be excessive; it should be a mixed manifestation based on existing abilities.

At the same time, such mutations do not mean everyone should switch Pathways, because switching Pathways usually brings something unavoidable: incompleteness and loss in a Pathway's ability set.

**Example:** Even if you are a Sequence 2 Seer who switches to Apprentice Sequence 1, you will almost permanently lose the Seer's Sequence 1 abilities. When facing a Sequence 1 Seer, you do not have much advantage; the abilities of that Pathway will be suppressed by the opponent. Unless you choose the extremely difficult option of switching back to Seer Sequence 0, but that would then force you to drink the Seer Sequence 1 potion again, and you would also lose the Apprentice Pathway's Sequence 0 abilities. This becomes a vicious cycle.

Switching Pathways is not recommended to loop back to your original Pathway. In the Lord of the Mysteries setting, if you use Beyonder Characteristics left behind by the death of other Beyonders to make potions, then for humans who advance step by step, that set of characteristics will, with high probability, contain a mixture of Beyonder Characteristics from all previous Sequence levels. This means you will drink redundant, duplicate characteristics, increasing your probability of madness and Loss of Control. [[Loss of Control]]

If you want to expel them, you would also need to give birth to a child. But if you do not do that, then you can only drink characteristics one level higher than you, which will then cause missing abilities.

**Example:** If a Seer Pathway Sequence 2 goes to Apprentice Sequence 1, then to Seer Sequence 0, and you do not have the prior characteristics, then your Seer Sequence 1 abilities may remain permanently vacant or incomplete, and you would also need to spend considerable effort. Of course, this is only an example - please forgive any omissions - but this is indeed very likely to occur.

Going to the end of a single Pathway does not mean you will be weaker than someone who switches Pathways. Granted, ability mutations from switching Pathways make one harder to guard against, but that is compensation for the losses caused by switching Pathways. If you covet a certain Pathway, you can absolutely obtain the corresponding abilities through Beyonder Items. [[Beyonder Item]]

### Rule 3: Switching to a non-adjacent Pathway

**Direct answer:** The first time you do this, you will most likely become half-mad, with a small chance of Loss of Control, but that does not mean this is an option you can gamble on lightly. [[Half-mad]]

Because no matter what Pathway you switch to, due to your already-precarious mental state, you will be unable to advance any further unless you separate out the excess characteristics. Otherwise, you will permanently remain at that level; drinking any potion will cause you to shift from half-mad to Loss of Control.

The half-mad state, in brief, is a period of calm, but at crucial moments you are easily overheated and impulsive because any stimulation makes you disregard all consequences. Damage from attacks on your Sanity / Rationality will also be more severe for you. Therefore, your state will also draw the attention of the orthodox churches, which may bring you a lot of trouble. [[Sanity / Rationality]]

In truly unavoidable circumstances, the best time to make this choice is before advancing to Sequence 0.

**Example (Lord of the Mysteries):** Emperor Roselle. As a transmigrator, he started with the Paragon Pathway, switched at Sequence 1 to the Hermit Pathway, and afterward forcibly made a reckless jump to Sequence 0 of the Black Emperor Pathway. The first two are adjacent Pathways; the last is a non-adjacent Pathway. However, due to the Black Emperor Sequence 0 resurrection ability, after advancing and becoming half-mad he immediately committed suicide, using that method to cleanse the madness; and during resurrection he could, through Authority, reclaim the three Black Emperor Sequence 1 characteristics and the Uniqueness, becoming a complete Black Emperor. [[Uniqueness]] Of course, his Paragon Pathway and Hermit Pathway characteristics were lost as a result. He was no longer a three-Pathway Beyonder, because the Black Emperor's return or resurrection does not bring back non-Black Emperor Beyonder Characteristics together.

This is only to provide one possibility. If it truly comes to the point of absolute necessity, a reckless Pathway jump may also be one of the options. But under non-emergency circumstances, it is absolutely not recommended, because even if you separate out the characteristics, those half-mad phenomena you originally had will still more or less remain in your mental consciousness, creating hidden risks for your future adventures.

Second, if you separate out the characteristics, then you also revert to the state you were in before drinking this new potion, equivalent to having done nothing.

Repeatedly doing this after separating them out will, with high probability, make you half-mad even under normal circumstances, and after trying again you will directly lose control.

## Source and Applicability

> GM Note: All of the above comes from a relatively reliable conclusion derived from the currently available information; it does not mean that the Lord of the Mysteries original work's settings must be exactly like this. If later the original work provides new text that overturns part of the content above, then please let the GM decide whether to prioritize the original work as the first priority. After all, a tabletop campaign is a product based on the original work.

> GM Note: Treat this only as a reference and do not take it too seriously. For tabletop play, Player experience is always the most important, and mutual respect with the GM is even more important.
