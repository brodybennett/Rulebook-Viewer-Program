# Misty Treants

> **Lore:** A monstrous, decaying, gigantic plant covered in various burrs. It sways from time to time, performing all kinds of weird movements, and moves slowly by dragging along the ground - leaving a trail of decay and terror.
>
> **Lore:** "Ah, no, this is the nightmare, this is the multiplier, that is the offspring of the earth. One day, the barren mistress will return to punish those who do not continue to evolve!"

## Habits

Misty Treants are usually produced from the [[polluted tree of life]]. They collect various creatures from the outside world, then place them into their own burl as a sacrifice to bring back the polluted tree of life - the remnant body left by the [[desolate mistress]].

A Misty Treant has many phantasmagoric abilities. It can always use the skills and superpowers of the creatures in its burl, making it a formidable opponent.

## Breeding Environment

Misty Treants can reproduce by budding. At the bottom of the plant is a true tuber that can grow new buds.

In some cases, after a terrible ceremony on the polluted tree of life, poor sacrifices will grow sprouts from various holes in the body and turn into new Misty Treants.

## Living Environment

Misty Treants live in remote dense forests and repeatedly plunder the surrounding population.

Wherever one is found, endless mists cloud spiritual intuition. In the mists, Misty Treants hunt their rivals wantonly.

## Turn Actions

Each turn, the Misty Treant has 4 actions. It randomly performs one of the following 6 actions:

1. **Move:** Move 2 meters in one direction. Creatures in this direction must pass a Dexterity check with Difficulty 20; otherwise, they suffer 3d6 damage.
2. **Use Pustule Human Ability:** Use the extraordinary abilities of a trapped Beyonder if known; otherwise, GM chooses a reasonable set.
3. **Hit with Sticks:** Deal 2d6 damage.
4. **Spray Thick Fog:** Visibility of the scene is reduced, and everything is considered invisible.
5. **Project Phantom:** Randomly project an image the Misty Treant has seen; this effect will change the scene.

> **GM Note:** In some cases, you can learn secrets of the past through the Misty Treant.

## Swallow Whole

- **Trigger/When:** If an unconscious creature is located next to a Misty Treant for a full round.
- **Effect:** The Misty Treant automatically swallows that creature inside, gaining all of its actively used extraordinary abilities.

## Skill Use via Swallowed Creatures

The Misty Treant itself does not have any skills, but it can be identified with the skills of the creatures it swallows, and use its own strength, agility, and constitution.

It can even use diplomacy, deceit, and speech skills. It is worth noting that the Misty Treant itself has no intelligence, so its words are often inconsistent and irrelevant.

## Uses and Materials

### Taste

Misty Treants cannot be eaten, but they can be used as high-quality firewood. It is said that food cooked with its wood has a particularly strong aroma.

There is a rhizome at the bottom of a Misty Treant. This rhizome absorbs the essence of its prey, so it is extra sweet, and can be used to make a powerful healing potion (restore 3d6).

### Common Items

- There is a huge rhizome at the bottom of the Misty Treant. Cooking and eating this root can restore 1d6 life.
- Its rhizome and juice can be used to prepare the [[Fool's Pathway Sequence 7 Magician's Potion]].
