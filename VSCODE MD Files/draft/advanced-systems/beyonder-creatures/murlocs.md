# Murlocs (Deep Divers)

Murlocs (deep divers) are relatively common sea monsters that seldom appear on major routes. They are Sequence 9 sailors.

## Description

- Murlocs usually have very low intelligence.
- They will jump on ships to attack people and cannibalize them.
- They pose a great threat to ordinary people; in an encounter, more than a dozen people may all die in battle.

> **Lore:** The cheek meat of a murloc is delicious whether eaten raw or boiled.

## Behavior

Example behavior:

- If a murloc is shot from one direction, it will immediately rush over with its teeth and claws.
- If another person shoots from another direction at that time, it will immediately be stunned, not knowing which one to pursue first.
- This can cause it to become a target again in the same place, be shot twice, and then keep looking for someone to pounce on.
- It might escape in the end.

## Durability

A murloc's protection is very thick. With proper preparation, ordinary (non-Extraordinary) hunters can hunt it, but it is still possible for it to escape.

## Materials and Value

- The swim bladder of murlocs is the main material of Sequence 9 sailors. [[Sailor]]
- It can be eaten except for the swim bladder (the main ingredient).
- A whole murloc can usually be sold at a market price of 150-200 pounds.
