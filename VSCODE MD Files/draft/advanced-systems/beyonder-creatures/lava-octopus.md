# Rava Octopus

## Description

A pale, bloodless, translucent octopus. Its flesh-and-blood brain sits at the center of its tentacles and visibly pulses with blue blood vessels. Blood is pumped back and forth along each tentacle; when blood reaches a tentacle's tip, it can fire rays with dire consequences.

> **Lore:** The RAW text alternates between "Rava Octopus" and "Lava octopus," but appears to describe the same creature throughout. [[UNCLEAR: The creature name is inconsistent ("Rava" vs "Lava") and the correct canonical name is not confirmed in this section.]]

## Habits and Society

> **Lore:** Rava octopuses are arrogant and curious, and they enjoy spying on other creatures' privacy to "reveal the truth." They often publicize a victim's private matters to various creatures in the [[LINK LATER: Astral World | type=location | hint=plane or realm referenced by extraordinary creatures]] as a joke.

> **Lore:** Rava octopuses possess a strong level of technology. By "revealing the future," they produce unreasonable technological creations.

- **Group size:** Rava octopuses live in packs, usually 3d6 individuals per habitat, forming a small society.

## Habitat

> **Lore:** Rava octopuses live in freshwater. They often dig caves in riverbeds to live in.

> **Lore:** They may enslave animals and humans, acquiring other low-level servants.

In dungeons, you can occasionally find high-tech items made by gold pounds or Rava octopuses. [[UNCLEAR: "gold pounds" is undefined here (creator, material, organization, or currency).]]

## Breeding Environment

> **Lore:** When breeding, Rava octopuses prefer to be surrounded by intelligent creatures.

- **Trigger/When:** After watching a Rava octopus mating process for several days (as described below).
- **Effect:** Triggers SC (1/1d6).
- **Special cases:** Rava octopuses may capture poor humans and stuff them into their technological creations, then watch their mating process for several days. [[UNCLEAR: Who makes the SC after observing the mating process is not specified (the captive humans, other observers, or anyone present).]]

## Basic Data

- **Attributes:** Charisma 4; Strength 2; Luck 4; Dexterity 2; Constitution 4; Will 5; Inspiration 5; Education 4.
- **Physical Defense:** 16 (10 + 4 deflection + 2 agility). [[LINK LATER: deflection | type=term | hint=defense component used in Physical Defense calculation]] [[LINK LATER: agility | type=term | hint=defense component used in Physical Defense calculation]]
- **Health:** 14
- **Skills:** Swimming; scouting; history; shooting proficiency; Intimidate; Pleasure; Deception; any two science skills trained.
- **First sighting:** A creature that first encounters a Rava Octopus suffers 0/1 SC. [[LINK LATER: SC | type=mechanic | hint=check referenced as X/YdZ throughout this entry]]

## Extraordinary Ability

### Colorless Ray

- **Use:** Up to 4 times per round.
- **Check/Test:** Make a shooting attack (+8) against the target's Physical Defense.
- **Effect:** On a hit, the creature or object becomes transparent.
- **Aftereffects/Consequences:** When a target is hit by this ray multiple times, resolve these effects in order:
1. **First hit:** Removes the victim's armor defense against that ray.
2. **Second hit:** Triggers SC (1/1d3) for seeing internal organs or other things.
3. **Third hit:** The victim is automatically blind (the light passes through the eyeball, so they can't see anything).
4. **Fourth hit:** The victim is automatically stunned.
- **Duration:** Ray-induced transparency is usually permanent until dispelled, or until the Rava octopus uses a [[LINK LATER: Reversal Ray | type=mechanic | hint=effect that dispels ray-induced transparency]].

## Common Items

> **Lore:** A Rava Octopus will carry a variety of tech items, plus other unreasonable technological creations.

### Star Crystal

An energy source that can be driven by unknown technology.

### Flying Chair

This chair can fly in the air, carrying the Rava octopus floating in the air. Otherwise, the chair can hold the creature at a distance and force it to look. [[UNCLEAR: "hold the creature at a distance and force it to look" lacks mechanical procedure, range, duration, and targeting details.]]

### Flying Eyes

A robotic device with wings that can fly and project images to the Rava Octopus's location.

### Communication Tentacles

Rava octopuses insert their tentacles into this device to communicate with companions.

### Protective Clothing

Like a transparent shield. Humans cannot wear it, but Rava octopuses can gain armor from it.

### Cutting Knife

Rarely used (since Rava octopuses are rarely trained in fighting skills), but some may have one to cut up prey.

- **Requirements:** Requires a special fighting skill, usually +7.
- **Use:** Can make 3 attacks per round.
- **Effect:** Each attack deals 1d6+1 damage.

## Culinary Notes

> **Lore:** If there is no special cooking method, Rava octopus tastes very fishy. Remove internal organs and clean it; use clear soup, sea salt, and pepper to bring out freshness and sweetness.
