# Black Panther

A beast covered in black texture - fast, very agile, and capable of shape-shifting. It lurks in the shadows, sneaks up, bites, then bites off its throat, and especially likes to eat human brains. Like an endless shadow, it pounced on the human body and began to bite quickly.

Terminology note: this entry treats "Black Panther," "Vile Panther," "evil-striped/evil-patterned black panther," and "fel-striped panther" as variant names for the same creature.

## Habits

Evil-striped panthers are efficient predators. By eating human brains, they can gain certain intelligence.

This kind of creature is very smart. They live in the wilderness, and they will find opportunities to enter human towns, bite a few people, and then hide back in the wilderness. Thankfully, the Vile Panther is a solitary creature.

Certain powerful Extraordinary people will keep evil-striped black panthers as pets.

## Note

> **GM Note:** Any kind of Extraordinary creature corresponds to a Sequence Pathway. The Extraordinary creature is essentially an Extraordinary creature that eats the Extraordinary characteristics of the wild, but does not take potions, resulting in a half-mad state.
>
> Therefore, for Extraordinary creatures without data, they can directly use the corresponding Extraordinary abilities, but the abilities are usually incomplete or incomplete, and their health and physique can be enhanced because they are not human.
