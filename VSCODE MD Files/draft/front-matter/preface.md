# Chapter 1: Preface

## About This Rulebook

> **Lore:** A being from the distant future - an Arbiter and Black Emperor dual-Pathway - turned history into concrete numbers, supported by two Pillars, in pursuit of a better ending.

This rulebook is a quantified adaptation of *Lord of the Mysteries*. Minor differences from the original work may exist, but the majority remains close to the source.

## Table Expectations

- Do not let rules quantification create conflict at the table.
- These rules are a reference. The **GM** may modify or fine-tune rules to suit their table.

> **Lore:** If you want to provide feedback, some editions include a discussion group for rulebook feedback.

## Beyonders in Play

> **Lore:** **Beyonders** are only powerful mortals.  
> As your **Sequence** level increases, you gain additional **Beyonder Abilities**, but aside from that, you are not substantially different from ordinary people.

## Five-Minute Character Creation Guide

Although the full rulebook is long, the core expectation is that Beyonders focus on setting and adventure. The length mainly comes from the many Sequences.

A Beyonder can complete a character sheet in about 5 minutes using the steps below, then quickly find a **GM** to begin play.

### Steps

1. **Download a character sheet.**
2. **Roll starting attributes.** In the group, enter the command: `.r 8#2d3`  
   The system generates 8 numbers. Fill them into your character sheet's attribute boxes in left-to-right order. (See [[LINK LATER: Chapter 3: Attributes | type=rule | hint=attributes chapter]].)
3. **Set Inspiration and Education.** Determine your **Inspiration** and **Education** values. Choose a number of **Trained Skills** equal to your Inspiration (example: if you have 6 starting Inspiration, choose 6 skills to be trained). Choose a number of proficient core-profession skills equal to your Education (example: if you have 6 starting Education, choose 6 skills to be proficient). (See [[LINK LATER: Chapter 4: Trained Skills and Professions | type=rule | hint=skills and professions chapter]].)
4. **Choose a Sequence.** Choose the **Sequence** you like. (See [[LINK LATER: Chapter 10: Sequences | type=rule | hint=sequence chapter]].) Add the attributes directly, then fill all **Beyonder Abilities** into the "Profession Description" section.
5. **Write your background and character concept.**

At this point, character creation is complete. Next, find a **GM** to start the game.

### Optional Reading

- In [[LINK LATER: Chapter 14: "Bombard and Kill Beyonders" Module Guide | type=rule | hint=module guide chapter]], find the Sequence you chose and read its general introduction, core [[LINK LATER: Acting | type=mechanic | hint=acting rules]] guidelines, and play style.

[[UNCLEAR: Some editions reference Chapter 14 under a different title ("The Hidden Sage's Diary"); confirm this crosslink points to the intended module guide.]]

## Supplementer's Note

> **Lore:** This supplement was created because the original D20 rules had incomplete/unclear data and some Sequence material was not synchronized with currently available Pathway materials and the novel's descriptions.  
> This content is shared non-commercially. The supplementer credits the original rules and will respond to author concerns; some editions provide a direct contact (QQ 2292545883).  
> This supplement does not supersede the original author. If the original author releases a new version, groups should prioritize it if they are willing.  
> If problems arise in play, the **GM** may adjust as they deem reasonable, and feedback is optional. The novel and general reasonableness are suggested as standards when resolving issues.
