# Chapter 8: Beyonder Items

This chapter covers **Beyonder Items**, including random generation, crafting approaches, and related reference material such as **Beyonder Characteristics**, **Amulets**, **Charms**, and an occult price list.

## Random Beyonder Item Generation

Use this procedure to generate a **naturally formed** Beyonder Item (not artisan-made).

[[UNCLEAR: This procedure assumes the item's Sequence rank is already known (e.g., from the Beyonder Characteristic used), but does not state how to determine it when generating "purely randomly."]]

### Step 1: Roll Pathway

Roll **1d24** on the list below. If the GM does not allow **Outer Deity** / **Dual-Pathway** Beyonder Items, remove entries 23-24 and roll **1d22** instead.

| Roll | Result |
|---:|---|
| 1 | [[Fool Pathway]] |
| 2 | [[Apprentice Pathway]] |
| 3 | [[Error Pathway]] |
| 4 | [[Visionary Pathway]] |
| 5 | [[Tyrant Pathway]] |
| 6 | [[Sun Pathway]] |
| 7 | [[Reader Pathway]] |
| 8 | [[Hanged Man Pathway]] |
| 9 | [[Death Pathway]] |
| 10 | [[Night Pathway]] |
| 11 | [[War God Pathway]] |
| 12 | [[Black Emperor Pathway]] |
| 13 | [[Arbiter Pathway]] |
| 14 | [[Red Priest Pathway]] |
| 15 | [[Demoness Pathway]] |
| 16 | [[Abyss Pathway]] |
| 17 | [[Mutant Pathway]] |
| 18 | [[Mystery Pryer Pathway]] |
| 19 | [[Paragon Pathway]] |
| 20 | [[Moon Pathway]] |
| 21 | [[Earth Pathway]] |
| 22 | [[Fate Pathway]] |
| 23 | Outer Deities |
| 24 | Dual-Pathway |

### Step 2: Roll Form

Roll **1d3** for the object's form of existence.

| Roll | Form |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Weapon |
| 2 | Carryable item |
| 3 | Apparatus placed somewhere |

### Step 3: Roll Benefits

1. Roll **1d2** to determine how many benefits the item has.
2. For each benefit, determine which **Sequence** the benefit belongs to. Identify how many Sequences are present in the item's Beyonder Characteristic, then roll **1d"number of Sequences"**. Map the roll from the *lowest included Sequence* (result = 1) up to the *item's Sequence* (highest result). Example given by the source: for a Sequence 7 item (that includes lower Sequences), roll **1d3** where result 1 is Sequence 9 and result 3 is Sequence 7.
3. If the Beyonder Characteristic used to make the item does **not** include lower Sequences, then you can only obtain Beyonder Ability benefits of its corresponding Sequence. Example (source): a typical Sequence 7 characteristic normally includes Sequence 9-8, but if you directly used a potion's main ingredient to make a Beyonder Item, or if the characteristic was shattered by a higher Sequence and reassembled, it may contain only Sequence 7.

After determining the Sequence rank for a benefit, consult the rulebook for the **Beyonder Abilities** corresponding to that Sequence. The attribute increase and Skills increase granted by a potion also count as a type of Beyonder Ability. Roll **1d"total number of Beyonder Abilities"** to determine which ability the benefit is.

Notes (source): Some Beyonder Abilities marked as "from potion" are integrated into the potion's attribute and Skills increases. As long as you gain the potion's Skills increase, you gain these "from potion" benefits as well. After becoming a Beyonder Item, a Beyonder Ability's manifestation form may change.

> **GM Note:** For example, [[Sun Pathway]] holy light might manifest as continuous damage applied to a weapon rather than summoned holy light. Decide how the ability manifests case by case.

### Step 4: Living Traits

Roll **1d2**. On a result of **2**, the item has living traits.

### Step 5: Roll Negative Effects

1. Roll **1d3** to determine the number of negative effects (1-3).
2. Determine intensity.

**Intensity if there is 1 negative effect**

| Roll | Intensity |
|---:|---|
| 1 | A negative effect that causes the user to possibly die, or to warp their personality for a long time or permanently. |
| 2 | If carried for more than a certain amount of time, it will almost certainly cause the user to die, or permanently warp their personality. |
| 3 | It will implicate people around the user, causing them to die for unknown reasons; it is almost periodic, occurring instantly, or continuing for a period of time. |

**Intensity if there are 2-3 negative effects**

| Roll | Intensity |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Under specific conditions or at regular intervals, the holder suffers strikes from Beyonder Abilities (area abilities may strike allies and enemies alike). |
| 2 | As above, and the holder also falls into a dangerous predicament. |

Mental contamination adjustment (source): If the Beyonder Characteristic contained by the Beyonder Item has mental contamination, remove the weakest intensity option. With **1** negative effect, do not use intensity 1 (choose/roll only 2 or 3). With **2-3** negative effects, do not use intensity 1 (only intensity 2 remains).

3. Determine the manifestation form of each negative effect (same structure as benefits): roll **1d"number of Sequences"** to determine the Sequence rank it manifests at, then roll **1d"total number of Beyonder Abilities"** to determine which Beyonder Ability it manifests as.

### Step 6: Finalize

After completing the above, the Beyonder Item is generated.

- This generation method is **not** artisan-made.
- It represents a Beyonder Item formed by natural combination of Beyonder Characteristics with surrounding things.
- Its benefits are far inferior to artisan-made Beyonder Items.

If you want artisan-made rules or further guidance, see [[Omniscient Pathway: Sequence 6 "Mechanics Master"]] (source notes this was formerly called "Artisan").

## Natural vs Artisan-Made Items

Key difference (source example):

| Item Type | Benefits Count |
|---|---|
| Naturally generated | **1d2** benefits regardless of how many Beyonder Characteristics the raw materials have. |
| Artisan-made | Benefits count equals the number of Characteristics contained in the item. |

Example (source): if a Sequence 5 characteristic contains characteristics of Sequence 9-6, the item may have 5 benefits, or even more.

## Quick Party Method: Obtain 1 Random Beyonder Item

Source method:

1. Make a potion out of a potion main ingredient / Beyonder Characteristic.
2. Find a carrier you want.
3. Pour the potion onto it.
4. After a short period of time, the Beyonder Item is complete.

## Destruction and Extraction Warnings

Warning (source): Once a potion main ingredient / Beyonder Characteristic becomes a Beyonder Item, only power of **Sequence 2 or above** can shatter it. You can no longer use it as other materials. [[Sun Pathway: Sequence 4]] can also extract the characteristic from within the item.

## Using a Matching Item

Using a Beyonder Item that matches your own Sequence rank and Pathway (source):

- You gain **no additional benefits**.
- Your abilities and the item's abilities completely overlap, unless it has some special mechanism.
- If you are weakened and your own abilities cannot be effectively used, you might use such an item to cast the complete abilities of the corresponding tier, raising the item to the same standard as your tier.

## Positive vs Negative Effects and Duration

General principle (source): A positive effect is usually equivalent to the positive ability granted by a Beyonder Sequence, while a negative effect is an uncontrolled ability that acts upon you.

Duration guideline (source): When calculating duration for Beyonder Items, it is usually **1d6 rounds**. Higher-Sequence items (such as Sequence 6, or Sequence 5 and above) have **permanent negative effects**.

## Effect Examples

These are examples only (source). Use them as inspiration when choosing or reskinning manifestations.

## Customizing Beyonder Items

Guidance (source): When customizing a Beyonder Item, choose the corresponding Pathway ability in advance, preferably using the abilities and data in the rulebook. Using rulebook abilities reduces review burden and lowers imbalance risk; modifications are allowed but should be careful. You do not necessarily need to restate exact data if you clearly describe how the ability manifests; checks and adjudication can then use the rulebook's original data unless special circumstances apply.

## Beyonder Item Creation Methods

Beyonder Items are usually created in three ways (source).

### Method 1: Potion-Infusion (Quick, Random)

1. Boil a Beyonder Characteristic into a potion.
2. Pour the potion onto an item.
3. A Beyonder Characteristic in potion form quickly merges into the nearest physical entity. If a potion is not consumed, it will ultimately merge with the bottle and become a Beyonder Item.

Notes (source): Abilities are usually random. Negative effects are usually not weak; drawbacks are at least equal in power and scale to the benefits. If it is not made into a potion, a pure Beyonder Characteristic will not merge into other items during storage, unless a Beyonder has just died and the separated Beyonder Characteristic naturally combines with surrounding things, producing a Beyonder Item, or it simply separates into the corresponding Beyonder Characteristic.

### Method 2: Paragon Artisan Forging

A Paragon artisan can forge Beyonder Items. See [[Paragon Pathway: Sequence 6]]. Artisan-made Beyonder Items have more controllable abilities and are closer to true Beyonders. Negative effects are usually not lethal.

> **Lore:** The source states artisan crafting fees are not cheap, and artisans are often found via the Church of Steam and Machinery, with some private artisans at sea.

### Method 3: Spiritual-Material Item-Making

Make Beyonder Items using spiritual materials rather than Beyonder Characteristics.

[[UNCLEAR: The source describes this as "on the basis of the second and third methods," which is self-referential; it likely means adapting other creation methods by substituting spiritual materials for Characteristics.]]

See also Beyonder Items Made from Spiritual Materials below.

## Beyonder Items Made from Spiritual Materials

Definition (source): These are Beyonder Items **without Beyonder Characteristics**. When destroyed, they do **not** yield Beyonder Characteristics. They have supernatural power, but their Beyonder effects gradually fade and disappear over time.

Core traits (source):
- Negative effects are not significant.
- Usually only **one** benefit.
- They cannot later be used as someone's potion main ingredient to advance.
- Compared to items made from Beyonder Characteristics, their abilities are usually weakened versions.

Fading timeline (source): The source states that after one or two years the effects are halved, and after another one or two years the Beyonder effects completely disappear. Later in the price list, the source states that effects are halved after about 1-2 years and completely lose Beyonder power after about 4-5 years.

[[UNCLEAR: Fade timelines for spiritual-material Beyonder Items are inconsistent (2-4 years vs 4-5 years to fully fade).]]

Price and power (source claim): Around 500 pounds (equivalent to the price of a Sequence 9 item), you can obtain the equivalent of a Sequence 6-tier ability. Higher-Sequence versions increase in price; Sequence 4 spiritual-material items are rare and priced at least close to 8,000 pounds.

### Example: Slowing Whip

Source example (Demoness Pathway Sequence 6 comparison):

- A Slowing Whip cannot be used like a Demoness with a casting action.
- It can only be used through a melee attack corresponding to the whip: Attack action is Fighting vs Physical Defense; it ignores part of the armor within Physical Defense (source wording).
- Each hit gradually slows the target, eventually achieving a binding effect.
- A true Sequence 6 Pleasure Demoness needs only one attack to achieve binding.
- A Slowing Whip usually needs **3 hits** to reach an effect equivalent to binding once; before that it reduces Agility step by step.

> **GM Note:** The source recommends setting clear limits so that any "Sequence 6-tier" spiritual-material item is reduced to Sequence 9-level impact where appropriate (e.g., splitting a complete ability into three parts so that three successful hits equal one "true" Sequence 6 application).

> **Lore:** The source states these items generally come from the Church of Steam and Machinery and that market sellers may be church informants.

## Beyonder Items Formed by Irregular Aggregation

Source concept: Some Beyonder creatures (especially ancient ones) may consume any abilities that look similar rather than following correct Pathway-switching rules, resulting in mutated, incomplete rationality and mixed abilities. The same can affect Beyonder Items.

Rules/guidelines (source): These items no longer possess corresponding Pathway Characteristics; ability types are entirely custom-defined. They generally have only **1** benefit, unless the GM allows increasing it to **2**. Producing them fuses various Beyonder materials together regardless of relation; if spiritual materials are used, the result is a spiritual-material Beyonder Item with an effective period, and if Beyonder Characteristics are used, it is permanently effective. You should obtain GM consent before choosing this type of Beyonder Item.

## Sealed Artifacts

A **Sealed Artifact** is a Beyonder Item whose negative effects are too great and must be sealed (source). It is a subtype of Beyonder Items.

See also [[Sealed Artifacts and Containment]].

### Sealed Artifact Grading (Orthodox Churches)

Grading is not entirely based on Sequence rank, but on harmfulness and containment difficulty (source). A Sealed Artifact may be graded as mid-Sequence tier even if its power is low-Sequence.

| Grade | Typical Correspondence |
|---|---|
| Grade 0 | Usually corresponds to Sequence 2 and above. |
| Grade 1 | Usually corresponds to the demigod level of Sequence 4-3. |
| Grade 2 | Usually corresponds to the mid-Sequence level of Sequence 7-5. |
| Grade 3 | Usually corresponds to the low-Sequence level of Sequence 9-8. |

### Naming Convention

To name a Sealed Artifact (source): start with its grade, then its number, then its name. Except for Grade 0, major churches basically do not share Sealed Artifact numbers to avoid revealing trump cards. Numbers other than Grade 0 can repeat between churches, and the grade number cannot be changed at will.

Example format (source): "Grade-Number 'Name'". Example: "3-508 'The Unceasing Nightmare'".

### Role in Orthodox Churches

> **Lore:** The source describes Sealed Artifacts as both dangerous items to contain and emergency tools. They are often kept behind a Chanis Gate in the Church of Evernight or a squad base, guarded long-term by an elderly Nighthawk volunteer.

Operational use (source): Official Beyonders may apply to use a local Sealed Artifact if an incident cannot be resolved by their own strength. The request typically includes the Sealed Artifact code and reason; approval involves the guard behind the Chanis Gate. A base with multiple Sealed Artifacts is substantially stronger in defense, including delaying a demigod.

> **GM Note:** If you are writing a Sealed Artifact rather than a standard Beyonder Item, the source suggests the GM may increase the strength of benefits or allow an additional benefit, ensure negative effects are powerful and severe (e.g., lethal after being held for about half an hour; sometimes merely touching can cause mental effects), expect that Sealed Artifacts often cannot be carried long-term by one person and may require rotating handlers, and require returning requisitioned Sealed Artifacts; failure may lead to punishment.

## Amulet Crafting

**Amulets** are low-tier Beyonder Items that every Beyonder can attempt to craft (source).

### Crafting Procedure

1. Prepare corresponding Pathway materials equivalent to those used to make Charms. See [[Charm Crafting in Common Ritual Magic]].
2. Carve the physical item shape (e.g., necklace, bracelet). This requires a Difficulty Value 15 Crafting (Manufacturing) roll.
3. Spend **10 minutes** carving, above the finished product: the Mysticism symbol of a god of the corresponding Pathway and the incantation of the corresponding Beyonder power, using a "mystic language that can pry at natural forces." Requirements: you must have one such language at **Proficient**, and your Mysticism must be **Proficient**.
4. Range constraint (source): If the owner of the honorific name you carve is only Sequence 3, you must be within the range of the same city as them. See [[Names and Honorific Titles of Mystical Deities and Angels]].

Result (source): The amulet is finished, and you immediately feel a vast and terrifying power appear in the room corresponding to that god. Duration is **1 year**. Once per year, it must be retraced once using Spirituality.

> **GM Note:** The source warns that crafting an amulet tied to a god antagonistic to the god you worship will likely draw intense malice (example given: an Eternal Blazing Sun believer crafting an amulet of the Lord of Storms of an adjacent Pathway).

### Amulet Effects Reference

General effect (source): If the Pathway has an Intuition (INT) bonus at Sequence 9, then an ordinary-person wearer gains the qualification to use Spirituality Intuition. See [[Spiritual Intuition]] and [[Special Actions]].

Other rules (source): An amulet's effect is unrelated to the Sequence level of the Beyonder who crafted it. Compared to Beyonders, amulets are more useful for ordinary people; Beyonders should generally consider Charms instead. If you use Spirituality materials to craft it in order to obtain Sequence abilities, that leaves the category of amulets and is closer to a Beyonder Item. All amulet effects cannot stack with the Pathway's original abilities.

Specific Pathway effects (source list):

| Pathway | Effects |
|---|---|
| Night Pathway | Fully resting requires only **7 hours**. When the wearer comes into contact with a potential event that might lead them into disaster, they may passively and immediately trigger Spirituality Intuition once. This does not include disasters involving demigods or above. |
| Tyrant Pathway | Gain **1** point of damage reduction. Swimming rolls gain a **+2** Modifier. Patience will imperceptibly decrease. |
| Sun Pathway (material: gold) | Gain **2** points of resistance to curses, cold, and toxins. Keeps the wearer physically and mentally healthy; feels warm and smooth to the touch. |
| Reader Pathway | Rolls related to Intuition (INT) gain a **+1** Modifier. You can finish in three days a book that would normally take a week. |
| War God Pathway | Rolls related to Strength (STR) and Constitution (CON) gain a **+1** Modifier. |
| Perfect One Pathway | When making an Untrained skill roll, make a Difficulty Value 20 Intuition (INT) roll. On success, the Untrained **-4** penalty becomes a **-2** penalty. |
| Earth Pathway | In natural environments, Stealth rolls gain **+1**. Normally, your base Constitution (CON) Defense value and Constitution (CON) rolls gain **+1**. |

## Charms

**Charms** are one-time consumables that store Beyonder Abilities and release them once (source).

Crafting note (source): Crafting a charm usually requires ritual magic, praying to at least a Sequence 3 Beyonder of the corresponding Pathway. See [[Common Ritual Magic]].

### Setting the Activation Incantation

After crafting a charm (source): Set an activation incantation in any Mysticism language. Unlike performing a ritual and praying for a response, using a charm requires you to shout (or softly shout) the words. The activation incantation should relate to the domain (examples: "Storm," "Crimson," "Light"). Speaking the activation incantation is **1 swift action**.

### Using a Charm

**Targeting others (source):** Using a charm that targets others uses **1 attack action**. Make a Throwing roll contested against Physical Defense to throw it. If the target is willing, and the final Throwing roll result exceeds Difficulty Value 10, you can hit the target.

**Using on yourself (source):** If you use a charm on yourself (enhancement-type abilities, etc.), it is **1 casting action**. Even if the original ability would be swift/free, it still uses a casting action in this case.

### Special Use (Aura Infusion)

Some charms may be used in other ways (source example: Arbiter Pathway charms). Using **1 swift action**, and continuously consuming **1 Spirituality each round**, you infuse Spirituality so the charm's aura spreads without being triggered. This causes a "Majesty-type" effect on surrounding creatures equal to the charm's Sequence level. See [[Pathway charm rules]].

Constraints (source): This requires continuously touching the charm with your hand. Although it is only a swift action each round, the Beyonder may be unable to perform a two-hit combo and can only fight one-handed.

### Offensive Charm Note

Source example: [[Sun Pathway: Sequence 4]] Sunflame.

Because a charm that targets others must first hit with a Throwing roll, an offensive charm may require two rolls: the Throwing roll, and then the original ability's hit roll. This encourages relying on auxiliary effects such as binding to maximize effect.

Special delivery option (source): You can hold the charm in your palm after activation and deliver it with your fist. Use a Fighting roll rather than a Throwing roll. This will generally cause you to also enter the ability's affected area and be impacted together with the enemy.

## Beyonder Characteristics

**Beyonder Characteristics** are the essence of Beyonder powers (source).

### What They Are

Source explanation (condensed, mechanics preserved):
- To obtain Beyonder Abilities, you drink a potion.
- A potion's main ingredient is a Beyonder creature; Beyonder creatures are animals that evolved after eating Beyonder Characteristics (or similar products).
- Beyonder Characteristics left behind on death are the "main ingredients" of potions.
- Potions are a human method to consume Beyonder Characteristics more safely, maintaining Sanity / Rationality.

Notes (source):
- When Beyonder Characteristics precipitate, they fuse with the nearest object (example: a human might leave an eye rather than a "standard" ingredient).
- Some Beyonder creatures' main ingredients are incomplete halves of a Characteristic; you may need both halves for a complete ingredient.
- Humans advancing step-by-step from Sequence 9 typically precipitate complete ingredients.

### Precipitating Beyonder Characteristics (After Death)

Time (source):

| Condition | Time |
|---|---|
| Dead Beyonder creature | **5 minutes** to precipitate Beyonder Characteristics. |
| Spirit that can possess inhabits the corpse | Can shorten from **5 minutes** to **1 minute**. |

Results (source): If it is a Beyonder creature, you obtain the corresponding main ingredient. If it is a Beyonder, one body part may fuse with the Characteristics and become the precipitated potion main ingredient (example: an eye).

### Preliminary Use of Beyonder Characteristics

Even if not consumed or made into a Beyonder Item, Characteristics can provide limited help (source).

Examples (explicitly labeled as rulebook setting by the source): A Marionettist's Characteristics can give you half-range vision of spirit body threads. A Nightmare's Characteristics cannot let you enter dreams, but can let you invade another person's dream within **5 meters**.

Action costs (source): Touching for spirit body threads vision consumes **1 swift action each round**. Invading a dream through Nightmare Characteristics is **1 casting action**.

Mental contamination (source): If the Beyonder Characteristics have mental contamination, each time you use/touch it once, you suffer **0/1 Sanity / Rationality loss**.

GM adjudication rule (source): The GM decides how a specific Beyonder Characteristic can be used and what effect it achieves. The achieved effect must be basic and not involve the core (example: you cannot manipulate spirit body threads purely by relying on Marionettist Characteristics; you can only gain vision).

### Turning Beyonder Characteristics into a Potion

Key issue (source): re-consuming Characteristics.

- A Beyonder creature's main ingredient is usually a pure Characteristic of a single Sequence (e.g., Sequence 5 includes Sequence 5 only).
- A Beyonder's Characteristic likely includes lower Sequences (example: Sequence 5 may include a complete set of 9-6).
- Consuming it to advance does not prevent the advancement, but it adds an extra set of lower-Sequence Characteristics. You must digest an extra set of Sequence 9-6, otherwise digestion/advancement difficulty will increase.

### Divining a Potion Formula

Source rule: A Beyonder Characteristic bearing a deceased person's mental imprint can be used to divine a potion formula known within that imprint. This usually causes the diviner to suffer the deceased person's Sanity / Rationality roll, which is very dangerous.

Reference (source): Determine the diviner's Sanity / Rationality loss based on the deceased person's Sequence level in life. See [[Sanity / Rationality Loss by Target Sequence]]. This may cause loss of control; only in sufficiently special and safe circumstances can this be done stably.

### Other Ways to Precipitate Characteristics (Including While Alive)

The source lists multiple methods:

1. **Producing offspring:** Mainly starting from Sequence 6. Sequence 7 and below requires a Difficulty Value 20 Luck roll each time. At the instant pregnancy occurs, Characteristics pass to the child and the Beyonder feels the reduction. This is uncontrollable and usually limited to surplus Characteristics and does not cause a loss of power; if enough children are produced, loss of power may occur (amount decided by the GM). From Sequence 4 onward, whether a child with Beyonder power is conceived becomes controllable, and you can precisely control how much is inherited (one point / one-third / one-half / all). The child does not need to be carried to term to inherit, and becomes an innate Beyonder or an innately incomplete Beyonder. See [[Expansion 3: Special Races]] and [[Expansion 5: Beyonders in Special States]].
2. **Becoming an Angel:** Starting from Sequence 2, use **1 full-round action** to expel surplus Beyonder Characteristics from your body. Only duplicate Characteristics can be expelled. You cannot expel non-duplicate Characteristics to lower your own status.
3. **Purification (Sun Pathway):** [[Sun Pathway: Sequence 4]] can precipitate Beyonder Characteristics. Timing must be precise; otherwise Sequence level may drop, because precipitation is prioritized from high to low. Special (source): Sun Pathway purification is ineffective against angels, unless the corresponding Sun Pathway is also an angel.

> **GM Note:** The source suggests that digesting surplus Characteristics is often the best option, as surplus Characteristics remain a burden if accumulated.

## Occult Price List

This section is a setting/economy reference (source). Use GM judgment for availability, especially at higher Sequences.

### Credit Skill Purchasing Power

What different levels of the Credit skill represent (source):

| Credit | Purchasing Power |
|---:|---|
| 0 | Usually only 20 suleys, or even penniless. |
| 2 | Average person level; can probably come up with about 5 pounds. |
| 4 | Wealthy; can probably come up with about 100 pounds. |
| 5 | Very wealthy; can probably come up with several hundred pounds. |
| 6 | Rich merchant; can come up with several thousand pounds. |
| 7 | Noble; everyday assets are close to ten thousand pounds. |
| 8 | Top-tier royalty or a monarch; can casually spend tens of thousands of pounds. |

### Currency Conversion

- 1 gold pound = 20 suleys
- 1 suley = 12 copper pence

### Beyonder Item Prices

**Single-use Beyonder items (such as Charms; they gradually lose Beyonder power as time passes) (source):** 5-10 pounds or higher. This range is limited to Charms of Sequence 9-7. Usually "priced but not on the market" and must be purchased in specific places and outside official jurisdiction; the GM should restrict Charm quantity. Higher-Sequence Charms represent higher prices. Starting from Sequence 5, Charms are "priced but not on the market." From Sequence 4 onward, Charms cannot be measured in money and cannot be obtained easily.

**Enchanted Bullets (source):** 10 pounds per shot (equivalent to enchanting a bullet with the power of a Charm).

**Low-Sequence Beyonder items with limited uses (e.g., anesthetic gas, sleep gas) (source):** 100-150 pounds. Gas-type items can be used over an area and can cause strong ordinary people, Sequence 9 Beyonders who rely on physique, and even higher-Sequence targets with insufficient constitution to fall unconscious. One bottle can be used three times; one-third of the gas is enough to achieve the effect. Improper handling may gas yourself.

**Beyonder items made from Spirituality materials equivalent to Sequence 6 (source):** 450-550 pounds. Usually only one advantage: negative effects are extremely weak. Usually can only be cast via the item itself as a medium. Example summary (source): a Slow Whip equivalent to a Sequence 6 Witch's Touch of Pleasure cannot be identified with a casting action; must use whip attack action (Fighting vs Physical Defense), ignore armor, and gradually inflict restraint; takes about three hits to fully produce one true restraint effect. Fade note repeated by source: effects halved after about 1-2 years; completely lose Beyonder power after about 4-5 years.

**Beyonder items with Beyonder Characteristics (effect close to original) (source):**

| Equivalent Tier | Price |
|---|---|
| Sequence 9 | About 500 pounds |
| Sequence 8 | About 1,000 pounds |
| Sequence 7 | About 2,000-3,200 pounds (2,000 pounds is generally a "friend price" and has no reference value) |
| Sequence 6 | About 3,500-4,500 pounds |
| Sequence 6 with almost no negative effects | About 7,000 pounds |

### Beyonder Characteristic Price List

Note (source): Because the main ingredient is essentially a Beyonder Characteristic, and some potions have two main ingredients, you can split the price accordingly as long as the total equals one Beyonder Characteristic. If buying a finished potion directly, the price is roughly cost price plus within 100 pounds; higher-Sequence potions may be marked up. Prices fluctuate by rarity (example: Moon Pathway Characteristics are scarce due to Sanguine monopoly; a Sequence 7 Characteristic can sell for 8,000 pounds when necessary).

Prices (source):

| Sequence | Price |
|---|---|
| Sequence 9 Beyonder Characteristic | 400-500 pounds |
| Sequence 8 Beyonder Characteristic | 600-700 pounds |
| Sequence 7 Beyonder Characteristic | 1,200-1,800 pounds |
| Sequence 6 Beyonder Characteristic | 3,200-4,000 pounds |
| Above that | Only by chance, not to be sought |
