# Chapter 9: Ritual Magic

## Overview

**Ritual Magic** is a prepared ritual that petitions high-ranking existences for power.

- For low-**Sequence** Beyonders, Ritual Magic is an effective way to pray to deities for assistance when facing problems they cannot handle, and it is the common method for producing most Charms.
- For high-**Sequence** Beyonders (starting from Sequence 3), they can pray to themselves and can use high-grade **Spirituality** materials they already possess to create more powerful Charms. See [[Spirituality]].

## Ritual Setup

### Location

1. Prepare a quiet, safe location where you will not be disturbed.
2. If you are outdoors or in another place that does not meet these requirements, you may drip a hydrosol similar to "Amanda" within the ritual's area to create a tranquil and holy essential oil, barely meeting the requirements.

### Deity Selection

Choose the deity you wish to pray to. Generally, you may only pray to the Seven Orthodox Deities; otherwise, you are very likely to draw dangerous attention from malicious and hidden existences.

### Required Materials

1. Three candles: two represent the deity and one represents yourself.
2. A vessel (a small silver bowl, or a large cauldron/small cauldron).
3. A small silver knife or **Holy Night Powder** (see Spirituality Wall).
4. Hydrosol, essential oils, and herbs that symbolize the corresponding deity. These please the deity and help the ritual officiant adjust Spirituality and enter the proper state. You may directly make these materials into the corresponding candles to omit this step. If a response is guaranteed, you may handle this perfunctorily or even skip it.
5. A pile of salt, clean water, imitation parchment, and a feather pen for writing (the parchment/feather pen may be replaced with items of the same function).

**Arrangement:** Place the candles that symbolize the deity at the upper-left and upper-right corners of the table. Place the candle that symbolizes yourself in the center. Arrange all items neatly in their proper places.

### Additional Required Materials

1. **Limited to making Charms/Amulets/Enchanted Bullets:** the material carrier corresponding to the **Pathway**'s Charm/Amulet/Enchanted Bullet. Its surface must be engraved with the corresponding deity's symbol. For material types, see Charm-Making Ritual below.
2. **Limited to ordinary people / Beyonders who have not obtained ritual enhancement through Beyonder abilities:** items such as a bell, crystal ball, silver cup, incense, etc. These assist the ritual officiant in guiding power within the body outward, in order to construct the Spirituality Wall.

## Spirituality Wall

A **Spirituality Wall** is an invisible wall formed using your own Spirituality as the construction material. It is created with a small silver knife or Holy Night Powder.

- **Effects:** Blocks aura; isolates sound.
- **Manifestation:** Invisible and unseen, but at the instant it forms people will feel the surroundings become sealed.
- **Fragility:** Relatively fragile. Any stimulus (opening a door and touching the Spirituality Wall, suffering impact, being attacked) will cause it to shatter.

### Holy Night Powder

- **Build (5 meters):** **1 Casting Action**, consume **1** point of Spirituality; single-use material. Sprinkle it over the area you need to construct; it can build a Spirituality Wall that encloses items or encloses a **5-meter** space.
- **Build (10 meters):** **1 Full-Round Action**, consume **2** points of Spirituality to create **10 meters**. See [[Full-Round Action]].
- **Special:** The consumption is equivalent across different methods.
- **Scent:** Smelling Holy Night Powder has a brief refreshing effect: Inspiration-related checks **+1 with Advantage** for **1 round**; cannot stack with other refreshing effects; cannot be used to resist Beyonder abilities; limited to refreshing once within **1 hour**. See [[Advantage / Disadvantage]].

### Small Silver Knife

- **Action:** **1 Full-Round Action**.
- **Cost:** Within each **5 meters**, consume **1** point of Spirituality. For every additional **5 meters**, you must spend **1 additional Full-Round Action**.
- **Required supplies:** coarse salt and clean water.

Sanctification procedure:
1. Insert the small silver knife into the coarse salt.
2. Chant an incantation in a mysticism language to sanctify the knife.
3. Then insert the knife into the clean water.

Building the wall: Construct a Spirituality Wall of any range, letting Spirituality surge from the blade tip so that the Spirituality Wall covers the area you point toward.

### Spirit-Body Creatures

- **Action:** **1 Casting Action** or **1 Full-Round Action**.
- **Cost:** For each **1** point of Spirituality consumed, you can create a Spirituality Wall within **5 meters**.
- **Notes:** Because they are inherently related to the Spirit World, they do not need Holy Night Powder or a small silver knife; they can directly let Spirituality surge from their fingertips.

**Non-spirit-body casters without ritual power enhancement:** Except for spirit-body creatures, Beyonders who have not obtained ritual power enhancement from their potion must use items such as a bell, crystal ball, silver cup, incense, etc. to assist their spirit in order to create a Spirituality Wall. This causes them to spend **1 additional Casting Action** before creating the wall.

- **Action:** **1 Casting Action** for standard walls; **1 Full-Round Action** for large-area walls (GM call).

### Reference Incantations

Reference incantations for sanctifying a small silver knife:

- "I sanctify you, blade of pure silver!"
- "I cleanse and purify you, so that you may serve me in the ritual!"
- "In the name of the Goddess of the Night, the Lord of Crimson," (may be changed to another deity)
- "You are sanctified!"

## Ritual Procedure

Formally beginning the ritual:

1. Use **1 Casting Action** to enter a meditative state, and light the three candles from left to right (you may light them with Spirituality).
2. Insert the small silver knife into coarse salt, chant the incantation, sanctify the knife, and create the Spirituality Wall; you may also use Holy Night Powder. This step may be done in advance. At this time, phenomena corresponding to the deity will generally appear at the scene (example omitted).
3. Drip the corresponding essential oil onto the candles, and burn the corresponding herbs in the vessel. If a response is guaranteed, you may do this perfunctorily or not at all.
4. On the parchment, write the symbols/representations corresponding to the power you wish to petition for.
5. Chant the deity's honorific name, **or** an honorific name you compile yourself that can equally point to Their authority and identity. The latter does not enjoy automatic responses, and hidden existences generally do not perform automatic responses anyway. For honorific names, see [[Names and Honorific Titles of Mystical Deities and Angels]].
6. After finishing the honorific name, immediately chant the content you are petitioning for. As long as your words are respectful and not blasphemous, you may improvise this part.
7. Chant the names of the herbs used to please the deity, and petition Them to bestow power upon you. If a response is guaranteed, you may skip this. **Interruptible Ritual Magic:** the interruption occurs at this step; Step 8 is the operation to continue the ritual after you return.
8. Drip one drop of essential oil onto each of the three candles. Finally, throw the parchment bearing the symbol of the power you petition for into the large cauldron to burn. The casting is complete.

> **Lore:** An extended example petition appears in the original novel (Volume 1, Chapter 86). Use it as setting flavor, not as required wording.

## Mysticism Languages

- All of the above should be performed in a mysticism language (Hermes, Ancient Hermes, etc.).
- Hermes only works if the real you in reality truly opens your mouth and speaks aloud.
- Other mysticism languages take effect as long as you silently recite them.

> **GM Note:** Hermes may have protective/concealing effects, while silent-recitation languages may increase risk (including accidentally reciting honorific names while asleep).

> **GM Note:** Encourage roleplay of the procedure, but avoid excessive repetition (e.g., fully roleplaying 3 rituals within 1 hour may feel bloated).

## Commonly Used Ritual Magic

This section covers commonly used Ritual Magic and simplified check procedures.

- Ensure the ritual officiant's Mysticism skill has reached **Advanced**, or that they have gained enhancement to Ritual Magic abilities through a potion, granting them qualification to use Ritual Magic.
- Even with enhancement, potion power usually grants qualification to learn rather than direct knowledge; Mysticism should still be trained.

### Universal Procedure

- **Procedure duration:** about **5 minutes**.
- **Mysticism check:** **Difficulty Value 20**. If you fully roleplay the ritual procedure, this Mysticism check is not required.
- **Luck check (non-believed deity):** If what you petition is not a deity you believe in or a deity that will definitely respond to you, also make a Luck check (**Difficulty Value 25**). On a **Critical Failure**, your Ritual Magic effect will be distorted.
- **Ordinary person or hidden existence:** Whether or not you meet the conditions, you must make a Luck check. Hidden existences generally will not give automatic responses.
- **Materials to please the other party:** Luck check **+2 with Advantage**. See [[Advantage / Disadvantage]].

Reference: use the **Universal Procedure** in this chapter.

### Special Cases

- **Demigod-level power:** Mysticism must reach at least **Scholar** to perform it. If making Charms/Amulets/Enchanted Bullets, you must also prepare the corresponding demigod material that can carry power.
- **Shallow faith toward all deities:** You need a Luck check when praying to any deity, unless you are a core member of the Church, a Nighthawk, or a noble or wealthy merchant who donates frequently; then you may receive a response even under shallow faith.
- **Only chanting an honorific name (without Ritual Magic):** Unless you are a bishop, senior deacon, or Blessed, you should at least be **Sequence 5**; otherwise, mere prayer is difficult to obtain a response. If necessary, you may make a Luck check (**Difficulty Value 20**).
- **Petitioning a deity hostile to your faith:** Adjacent Pathways and the opposition between Orthodox Deities and evil deities are hostile relationships. Among the Seven Deities, the Church of Storms will also view the Eternal Blazing Sun as an enemy, even though both are Orthodox Deities. When petitioning a hostile deity (or a deity hostile to you personally), if the Luck check fails you will suffer punishment, or even be erased (depending on circumstances).
- **Petitioning a deity you do not believe in, but where the petition content relates to Their believers:** A response may still occur (example omitted). Even so, if you do not believe in Them, then like an ordinary person you must satisfy both date and time conditions to reduce the ritual's difficulty and obtain a response. If both are satisfied, and you are a Beyonder, then the Luck check defaults to success.

> **GM Note:** "Three-surname servant" caution: deeply believing in multiple deities risks punishment if exposed before them; adjudicate consequences by circumstances.

### Suitable Dates and Times

In Lord of the Mysteries, the Seven Deities each symbolize a different day of the week. Performing Ritual Magic during these periods significantly increases success probability.

| Day | Deity | Represents | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Monday | Earth Mother | Saturn (Brown Star) | change, acceptance, purely Yin |
| Tuesday | Lord of Storms | Jupiter (Orange Star) | expansion, luck, more Yang |
| Wednesday | God of Combat | Mars (Red Star) | conflict, drive, more Yang |
| Thursday | Eternal Blazing Sun | the Sun | energy/creation, purely Yang |
| Friday | God of Steam and Machinery | Venus (Venus) | harmony, balance, more Yin |
| Saturday | God of Knowledge and Wisdom | Mercury (Blue Star) | rationality, communication, neutral |
| Sunday | Goddess of the Night | the Moon | limitation, contraction, more Yin |

> **Lore:** The day mapping is attributed to official author-account content and corroborated by original text.

**Effect (suitable dates)**
- Ordinary people praying to the deity they believe in no longer need a Luck check.
- Mysticism check requirement: **-5**.
- Luck check Difficulty Value for praying to a non-believed deity: **-5**.

**Suitable times (optional)**
- Moon Hours (Goddess of the Night): Sunday **2-3 a.m. / 9-10 a.m. / 4-5 p.m. / 11 p.m.-0 a.m.**
- Blue Star Hours (God of Knowledge and Wisdom): Friday (**not a typo**) **0-1 a.m.**; Saturday **11-12 noon**; (**no explicit date in the original novel**) **4-5 p.m.**; (**no explicit date in the original novel**) **11 p.m.-0 a.m.**

- The effect provided by suitable times is identical to suitable dates and can stack.
- Both Difficulties are **-5 again**.

Note: Entries with "no explicit date" are lore-only and do not grant mechanical timing benefits unless the GM assigns a date.

## Charm-Making Ritual

To take away Beyonder power bestowed by a deity, you must provide a carrier that can bear these powers.

### Charm Materials

Charms materials not listed can be judged by making a **Reputation** check (**Difficulty Value 15**) to determine whether they can be purchased.

| Pathway | Charm material |
|---|---|
| Fool Pathway | a mixture of pure silver and mercury |
| Door Pathway | gemstones |
| Perfecter Pathway | bronze |
| Sun Pathway | gold |
| Storm Pathway | tin |
| Reader Pathway | mercury and brass |
| God of Combat Pathway | iron |
| Night Pathway | pure silver |
| Moon Pathway | silver or pure silver |
| Earth Pathway | lead |

Cost notes:
- Among the above Charm materials, the Storm Pathway is the cheapest, and the Sun and Door Pathways are the most expensive.
- Storm Pathway materials are priced in suleys.
- Sun Pathway and Door Pathway materials usually start around **1 pound** with fluctuations.

**Crafting**
- **Check:** Crafting (**Difficulty Value 15**).
- First carve the materials into a palm-sized Charm shape.
- Engrave/draw the corresponding deity's symbol on both the front and back.

### Charm-Making Procedure

1. Place the Charm materials you prepared in advance above the altar.
2. Based on Commonly Used Ritual Magic, choose a deity and chant Their honorific name; in the petition content clearly chant the content related to the Charm you want to make.
3. You may choose a Sequence **9-6** ability of the corresponding deity's Pathway. A Sequence **5** Charm requires you to know the corresponding Mysticism knowledge; the standard reference is Mysticism skill reaching **Scholar**.
4. Special (God of Knowledge and Wisdom): You may choose Sequence **9-6** abilities from all **22 Pathways**. The power granted is originally a Beyonder ability with **halved effect** (not halved for the Reader's own Pathway).
5. Petitioning a hidden existence (i.e., not among the Seven Deities), if you are not a Blessed of that hidden existence: that hidden existence generally will not proactively respond to you. Even if your ritual is responded to, Charm-making still needs to wait **1d24 hours** to succeed (response may be whimsical). Leave the materials on the altar overnight, unless you are guaranteed to obtain a response.
6. Shelf life and storage: the finished Charm has a shelf life of **one week**; after one week, its Spirituality dissipates. You may pray again to recharge it. If the Charm is stored for more than **4 days**, the Charm's power is **halved**.
7. Demigod and higher-level Charms require a more special carrier of Beyonder power to craft (e.g., a demigod's own blood), plus the materials listed above.
8. For specific Charm effects, see [[Expansion 2: Official Church Members]] and [[Charms]].

## Interruptible Ritual Magic

Some grander, more powerful, higher-level Ritual Magic requires several hours up to a full day.

- Normally, a Beyonder must continuously maintain casting in front of the altar throughout the ritual, or the casting is interrupted.
- **Interruptible Ritual Magic:** include wording petitioning the deity to "wait" during the petition (Step 7 of Ritual Procedure), allowing you to temporarily leave while the ritual is still maintained.
- **Prerequisite:** the deity has already responded to you. If your Ritual Magic check fails, "interruptible" cannot apply.

> **GM Note:** The source text warns against trivial wording when asking the deity to "wait"; treat as setting consequence guidance.

After successfully performing an interruptible ritual:

1. **Freedom of movement:** You can begin to move freely and do not need to stay within the Spirituality Wall's area of the ritual.
2. **Leaving the scene:** Because the Spirituality Wall is fragile, if you want to leave you must first use the small silver knife to cut an invisible exit into the Spirituality Wall. After you return, fill the Spirituality Wall's exit back in; filling the exit is **1 Swift Action**.
3. **Continuing the ritual after interruption:** Requires **1 Casting Action** and **2 Swift Actions** (entering meditation, completing the latter half of the ritual, and chanting the petition content). Return to the altar and chant the petition content again to indicate you wish to continue.

---

## Power-Petition Ritual

A **Power-Petition Ritual** is based on the Charm-making ritual, but you do not prepare materials, you do not petition to make a Charm, and you petition the corresponding deity to bestow power within the ritual's area.

**Warning:** In a Power-Petition Ritual, all Spirituality consumed by the deity is paid by you. Petitioning abilities of too high a level of Rank may drain your Spirituality dry and bring loss of control. See [[Extra: Rank Suppression]].

Detailed procedure recap for luring an enemy into the ritual area:

1. During the petition, make an Interruptible Ritual Magic request once, to ensure you can regain freedom of movement and lure the enemy into the ritual area; alternatively, teammates may do this.
2. On the Spirituality Wall that encloses the entire area, use a silver dagger to outline a door shape, ensuring you can enter/exit through this "door" without being affected.
3. Bring the target into the ritual area through the opened "door," then use **1 Swift Action** with the silver dagger to immediately fill the door back in.
4. Immediately rush back to the altar. Through chanting and brief meditation (**1 Casting Action** and **2 Swift Actions**), tell the deity the target has arrived, the power can begin to descend, and complete Step 8 in the Ritual Procedure (counted within the above action costs). During this time, you may be attacked.

---

## Divination Ritual Magic

Any magic that petitions an existence through Ritual Magic to obtain answers belongs to this category.

- Divination through Ritual Magic does not include common types such as Tarot cards or pendulums.
- Divination relying on third-party power: the most common is Magic Mirror Divination; the spirit-writing game / planchette also belongs to this category.

### Magic Mirror Divination

**Requirements:** Prepare a silver-plated mirror. Pray according to the prescribed procedure.

**Resolution notes:** Because the response is given by a deity, this divination generally defaults to success. You must still prepare clues, divination wording (recited during the prayer), and items related to the divination target. A deity cannot provide information out of thin air, nor divine matters unrelated to you.

**Ordinary people:**
1. Must pray on the suitable date of the corresponding deity.
2. Must bathe.
3. After praying **seven** times, lightly toss the mirror onto the ground (must be very light).
4. The pattern of the mirror's shattering is the revelation.
5. Interpreting revelations: Mysticism must reach **Expert**, or make a Mysticism check (**Difficulty Value 25**); otherwise interpretation is almost impossible.

**Beyonders:** Can directly see images/text in the mirror and obtain relatively clear information.

**GM adjudication:** The specific information granted is decided by the GM. Do not create information from nothing. Prepare enough clues in advance, unless the divination content is related to yourself.

**Warning:** Magic Mirror Divination lacks protection. The responding target can directly emerge from the mirror in spirit form and possess you, etc., which may cause Beyonder incidents or leave aftereffects. Petitioning a hidden existence is quite dangerous for Magic Mirror Divination; petitioning the Seven Deities is a more suitable choice.

---

## Seance Ritual Magic

Based on the universal procedure:
- The area must have at least a spirit.
- [[id:alias-spirit-vision|Spirit Vision]] can let you discover spirits that are not of a high level.

### Seancing the Dead

- If you are not a medium of the Death Pathway, it is difficult to find the spirit of someone who has been dead for a long time.
- If there is a corpse that has just died before you, or a corpse that has been dead for no more than **1 day**, you can conduct a seance on the soul that has not yet fully dissipated.

After successfully performing the ritual, you will sense thoughts and mind that have not yet dissipated.

If you are not a Death Pathway Beyonder, you can perform the seance by using [[Dream Divination]]. Treat this as Dream Divination that satisfies all clues and conditions: write down the divination wording and use it to peer into the spirit's memories. Seance achieved through dialogue can only be done by a medium.

Limits and decay:
- Such Dream Divination seance causes wear to the spirit; generally you can only obtain **1d2** answers in this way.
- Spirits dead for more than **one week** completely dissipate and can no longer be contacted, even for a medium.
- Spirits dead for more than **1 day** can no longer be seen by ordinary Beyonders. They can only roughly confirm the location and set up Ritual Magic, unable to confirm whether the spirit truly still exists there. If it exists, the seance is still valid.
- The longer the time since death, the less detailed the information obtained; vagueness is decided by the GM.

### Seancing the Living

Seance can also affect living people.

**Requirements:** Target must be in a muddled state such as sleep or coma.

**Methods:** If the target is willing, you can use less violent methods such as Amanda Hydrosol, Spirit Eye Potion, etc.

If you are not a medium, unlike seancing the dead, you can normally ask questions with language and they answer. The number of questions is not limited.

**Manifestation:** Both parties' Spirituality communicate. Your Spirituality passes through the other party's storm of thoughts, and you see their illusory figure within the mental body.

**Warning:** If you seance a living person who is already mad, you are very likely to suffer the same Sanity Loss check as the one that drove them mad, and the final madness symptoms will match theirs. See [[Sanity / Rationality Loss Rolls]]. Taking a "Tranquility Potion" can let you maintain lucidity and reason while seancing a target with madness symptoms. See [[Chapter 15: List of Special Potions, Talismans, and Beyonder Items]]. If the target's madness involves contamination from a power **1 Rank higher than you**, you may still be affected. See [[Extra: Rank Suppression]].

---

## Spirit-Descent Seance Ritual

This is another use of the seance ritual.

Two uses:

1. **Direct communication:** Completing the ritual enables remote dialogue with the prayed-to target. Starting at angel-level, the target may not fully respond according to the ritual's requirements and may instead use spirit-descent.
2. **Spirit-descent:** Prepare a paper doll (or similar) and place it on the altar as the carrier for "spirit descent." If you do not have such an item, the petitioned target will "descend" onto your body: the possessed person completely loses consciousness, is controlled, and answers others' questions; **or** the possessed person remains conscious and can control certain parts of the body for Q&A (e.g., one speaks; the other writes). Which use occurs depends on your prayer content during the petition.

Restriction: You cannot petition deities in this ritual. Honorific names of deities (e.g., "Goddess of the Night," "God of Knowledge and Wisdom") cannot appear in the ritual, otherwise it will inevitably fail.

> **Lore:** The ritual is associated with the Seven Lights of the Spirit World; see [[Chapter 12: Special Regions]].

---

## Portrait Ritual Magic

Based on the universal procedure: select a target, perform the ritual, and pray to a deity.

**Effect:** Your body will act as if controlled, scribbling furiously. Within **1 Full-Round Action**, you draw a vivid portrait of the target.

**Requirements:** The selected target must have some information you possess; the ritual cannot be established without that.

Anti-divination interaction:
- This is affected by anti-divination.
- Ritual Magic generally acts on the scene rather than on you personally. When performing anti-divination, you must anti-divine the scene's Mysticism information; anti-divination against you personally is not necessarily fully effective.
- If you reproduce a scene you have seen before, it is not affected by anti-divination (tracing your own memory).
- If the target used disguise (including physical disguise or appearance-changing abilities), the portrait reflects the disguised appearance.

> **Lore:** The portrait is described as photo-realistic; official Beyonders may use it for wanted portraits.

---

## Pact Ritual

Based on the universal procedure:

- Prepare materials rich in Spirituality (preferably a Beyonder's blood).
- On a piece of animal leather, write the honorific name of the pact target and draw the corresponding symbolic marks and magical signs.
- If necessary, consider specific times and environments (usually not needed).

Procedure: Pick up the leather, continuously recite the honorific name, and let your Spirituality spread into the leather. Spirituality gradually diffuses and aligns with the corresponding great hidden existence, obtaining corresponding spiritual experiences or certain assistance.

Outcome: The final result is unknown; it depends on what the great hidden existence gives. The specific result is decided by the GM.

---

## Artificial Sleepwalking Ritual

An application of spiritualism using higher spirits; at its extreme, it can let Beyonders (with strange lucidity) mentally roam the Spirit World.

- Some Beyonders call it "artificial sleepwalking."
- With hypnosis and other techniques, they can also bring ordinary people into this state: ordinary people appear asleep, yet can answer questions. They can discover spirits around them and complete a degree of communication.

Difference from Pact Ritual:
- Pact Ritual generally achieves effects that directly act on the ritual performer.
- Artificial Sleepwalking Ritual can indirectly affect the outside world; a responding target can help you achieve anti-divination.

Anti-divination guidance:
- The effect and Rank of anti-divination depends on the petitioned target.
- If a deity responds to a prayer, then in most cases those below angels cannot successfully divine. The GM may roll a suitable anti-divination Difficulty, and ignore critical successes against targets less than two Ranks below.
- The anti-divination effect cannot last; it only targets information about a certain matter or a certain area.
- Receiving such a blessing does not mean all subsequent divinations and prophecies become ineffective.
- Usually, divinations lower than the petitioned target by **2 Ranks** will obtain answers that seem "reasonable" but do not match the truth - i.e., "no problem."

---

## Sacrifice Ritual Magic

Based on the universal procedure: place the things to be sacrificed on the altar. The candlelight surges up and forms a mottled bronze doorway, sweeps up the things you sacrificed, and sends them to the corresponding deity, provided the other party accepts.

## Request-Bestowal Ritual Magic

Reverse the Sacrifice Ritual Magic: the opened bronze doorway, in reverse, has the deity bestow something to you. This situation is very rare.

## Summoning Ritual Magic

Summoning Ritual Magic does not necessarily point to the Seven Deities; it may be praying to your own Spirituality or to the Spirit World.

- What is usually summoned: Spirit World creatures (then you sign a contract with them), or (extremely rarely) a subordinate of some deity.
- For summoning Spirit World creatures, see [[Chapter 12: Special Regions]] and [[Spirit World]].

---

## High-Tier Ritual Magic

High-Tier Ritual Magic is generally the use of mid-Sequence or demigod-level abilities by low-Sequence casters.

It is essentially a Power-Petition Ritual but can include demigod or higher-level abilities.

**Requirements:** Mysticism skill should reach at least **Scholar**.

**Costs and materials:** Like Power-Petition Ritual, it consumes the caster's own Spirituality. To fill the Spirituality consumption, you may need to perform Ritual Magic multiple times to repeatedly pay out Spirituality (breaking a high-level ability into steps), **or** prepare a large amount of materials rich in Spirituality to substitute for the corresponding consumption. If creating certain things (e.g., Life Creation), you may also need many other materials; some may violate ethics and morality depending on the effect desired.

> **Lore:** The source provides an example "Life Creation / Resurrection" materials list and procedure notes; treat as setting reference and GM-adjudicated outcome.

---

## Permanence Ritual Magic

A High-Tier Ritual Magic, limited to Beyonders whose Mysticism has reached **Scholar**.

**Effect:** If you have a Beyonder item that is not permanently effective (has a duration), you can petition the corresponding Pathway's deity to permanently fix the item's duration. In essence, the deity continuously lends power to the item.

**Risks:** Deities hostile to the deity you believe in will not respond to you, and you may suffer divine retribution.

Spirituality consumption:
1. Base consumption: **40** points of Spirituality (regardless of the Beyonder item's tier).
2. For each **Sequence** level equivalent of the Beyonder item's strength: **+5** Spirituality.
3. For each **Rank** equivalent of the Beyonder item's strength: **+10** Spirituality.

Example (as written in the source): Making permanent a Sequence 4-tier Beyonder item consumes at least **70** points of Spirituality, and only if the corresponding deity is willing to respond.
