# Madness and Losing Control

## Sanity / Rationality Loss Rolls

Certain Beyonder effects that impact Sanity / Rationality, and certain mythical scenes, may require Sanity / Rationality loss Rolls.

### Making a Sanity / Rationality Loss Roll

| Step | Rule |
|---|---|
| Roll | Roll 1 rd20. |
| Success | rd20 <= your current Sanity / Rationality. |
| Failure | rd20 > your current Sanity / Rationality. |

### Sanity / Rationality Loss Values (X/Y)

Loss values are written as X/Y.

- On a successful Sanity / Rationality loss Roll, lose X.
- On a failed Sanity / Rationality loss Roll, lose Y.

Example: If the loss value is 1/1d3, on success lose 1; on failure lose 1d3.

### Unfavorable Modifiers

Some effects apply +1 or +2 unfavorable to your Sanity / Rationality loss Roll.

- Replace rd20 with rd20+1 or rd20+2 (as instructed).
- Because failure is "final result > current Sanity / Rationality," this only makes failure more likely.

### Critical Failure (Sanity / Rationality Loss Rolls)

- There is no critical success.
- If the base rd20 roll is 20, it is a critical failure.
- On critical failure, Sanity / Rationality loss is the maximum possible value.

### Special Rule: Advancement Sanity / Rationality Rolls

For advancement Sanity / Rationality Rolls only, there is no critical failure and no critical success.

## Falling into Madness

If you lose 3 points of Sanity / Rationality from a single instance of loss, you enter a madness / half-out-of-control state.

## Half-Out-of-Control State

**Duration:** Roll 1d2; the result is the number of rounds this state lasts.

**Immediate effects:**
- You cannot take movement actions.
- Using Beyonder abilities immediately causes 1/1d2 Sanity / Rationality loss.

**Start-of-turn Willpower test:** At the start of your turn each round, make 1 Willpower (WIL) Roll (Difficulty Value 10). On failure, suffer 0/1 Sanity / Rationality loss.

**Mythical symptoms and recovery:** From the start of this state, your body shows mythical / out-of-control symptoms (for example, nails or hair growing wildly, or sensations like insects beneath the skin). For specific appearance, see [[LINK LATER: Chapter 11: Manifesting Mythical Creature Form | type=rule | hint=out-of-control appearance]]. When this state ends, you return to normal actions. The bodily changes require 5 minutes of sufficient rest to recover. Hair and nail overgrowth and similar changes remain until cut off.

**Madness tendency during the state:**
- Roll 1 ".ti" to determine your madness tendency. If you do not have the ".ti" command, roll on the Madness List below.
- While you are in the half-out-of-control state, you must act according to the rolled result.

**Resisting a madness action:** Each time you would take an action related to the rolled madness tendency, you may make a Willpower (WIL) Roll (Difficulty Value 15) to resist and not perform that action. If the rolled madness is the memory loss type, this Roll is instead to recall your current situation.

## Falling into Indeterminate Madness

If your current Sanity / Rationality is below half of your Sanity / Rationality maximum (rounded up), you fall into indeterminate madness.

## Indeterminate Madness

Every 12 hours, roll 1 ".ti" to determine your madness symptom. Indeterminate madness resides in your subconscious. If you roll an unreasonable madness, you may reroll. If you do not have the ".ti" command, roll on the Madness List below.

### How Indeterminate Madness Plays

Indeterminate madness has no required external manifestations, but during the madness period your actions must match the rolled tendency. The GM may reframe the rolled madness into a more euphemistic form.

**Examples of presentations (non-exhaustive):**

| Tendency | Possible presentation |
|---|---|
| Violent tendency | More impatient; solve problems roughly. |
| Avoidance | Avoid problems; thoughts of giving up. |
| Amnesia | Worsened memory; forget key points. |
| Fainting | Sudden exhaustion; vision darkens; require immediate rest. |

**GM Note:** In some cases (such as amnesia), the GM may choose not to tell the Player certain information, and later have the Player recall it, explaining that because of this madness, some things happened that the Player did not know and forgot.

## Removing Indeterminate Madness

By any method of recovering Sanity / Rationality, restore your Sanity / Rationality to above half, and you remove indeterminate madness.

## Other Effects of Indeterminate Madness

**Ongoing effects:**
- Every 24 hours, you must suffer 1 instance of 0/1 Sanity / Rationality loss.
- Sufficient sleep can no longer restore your Sanity / Rationality unless the sleep has Beyonder factors helping (the [[LINK LATER: Night Pathway | type=pathway | hint=sanity recovery during sleep]] has this by default). You will be in a state of anxiety, insomnia, and similar symptoms.

**Split-personality trigger:** If, because of indeterminate madness, your remaining Sanity / Rationality is below 3, or you are in indeterminate madness for 1 week, you develop split-personality symptoms and a second personality appears within you.

**Early stage:**
- The second personality has no symptoms.
- Removing indeterminate madness during this time can prevent the second personality from taking root.
- But once the conditions for the second personality are met: regardless of your current Sanity / Rationality, as long as you are still in indeterminate madness and the second personality has existed for 1 month, you inevitably hear the second personality's voice.

**Nature of the second personality:**
- It is essentially a mental illness, not a second person.
- It will not hide.
- It knows everything you know.
- It uses what you worry about most and least want to face to deny you, making you gradually fall into the abyss of Loss of Control.

**Required response:** The second personality is played by the GM and only you can hear its voice. You must immediately undergo either at least 1 month of psychotherapy, or if you are [[LINK LATER: Spectator Pathway | type=pathway | hint=psychological guidance]] Sequence 7 or above, at least 2 weeks of psychological guidance once per day. You can also find a way to directly enter your own mind and confront the second personality to eliminate it; it currently cannot resist.

**Persistence after growth:** If the second personality continues to grow for 1 month, then even if you are no longer in indeterminate madness it continues to exist and you still suffer all disadvantages brought by indeterminate madness. You must frequently recover Sanity / Rationality to maintain Sanity / Rationality.

## Eliminating the Second Personality

1. Continuously receiving normal psychotherapy can only make you no longer suffer the disadvantages brought by indeterminate madness. For a [[LINK LATER: Spectator Pathway | type=pathway | hint=psychotherapy duration]] Sequence 7, psychotherapy requires 5 years to be cured.
2. On this basis, for each additional Sequence level the Spectator has, reduce the required time by 1 year. For each additional Rank, reduce the required time by another 1 year. Minimum time: 1 week, with treatment once per day.
3. Another cure method is to enter the deepest part of your mind (the bottom layer of dreams) and fight the second personality. Its strength is equal to yours. If you die here, the challenger becomes a vegetative state. Psychological suggestion prepared in advance also takes effect on it. If the second personality is killed, your illness is cured. Because its strength is equal to yours, generally only others can resolve it.

## Loss of Control

If, under any circumstances, your Sanity / Rationality reaches 0, you immediately suffer Loss of Control.

- You immediately transform into the corresponding out-of-control being. For appearance, see [[LINK LATER: Chapter 11: Manifesting Mythical Creature Form | type=rule | hint=out-of-control appearance]].
- Your character sheet is considered dead.
- Loss of Control is, in essence, becoming a monster in the corresponding mythical form.

[[UNCLEAR: The text states the out-of-control state cannot be reversed, but later states Loss of Control can be reversed starting from Sequence 2 with outside help; confirm the intended exception and its limits.]]

## Becoming Out of Control

| Sequence | Result |
|---|---|
| Before Sequence 4 | After losing control, unlike "half-mythical creature form," you no longer have human features. The transformed mythical form does not have special benefits and only gains the corresponding attribute increases. |
| Starting from Sequence 4 | You transform into an out-of-control being that enjoys special benefits as well as corresponding attribute increases, posing an enormous threat. |
| Starting from Sequence 2 | Loss of Control can be reversed with outside help that restores your Sanity / Rationality. |

This means the helper must face a "boss" like you, with enormous risk. The specific reversal method depends on the reason for Loss of Control. Advancement Loss of Control may be due to precipitating characteristics the body cannot bear; disconnection between the main body and an avatar may require re-establishing the connection.

## Creature Type / Death of an Out-of-Control Being

- Before Sequence 2, an out-of-control Beyonder is considered, in essence, already dead, and will suffer special strikes against undead.
- Out-of-control beings still have Spirit Body Threads, but cannot be made into marionettes and the like; this will cause even a Marionettist to suffer mental pollution.
- After losing control, your character sheet is controlled by the GM. You irrationally destroy and slaughter all things. If you die, you leave behind Beyonder characteristics / Beyonder items bearing your mental pollution (formed by combining with some body part or carried item). These usually have enormous negative effects, cannot be ingested directly, and even if used as items, also bear negative harm.

## Madness List

(For in-person games, or other situations without the ".ti" command.)

1. Violent tendency: You begin to solve problems in a more irrational way, prioritizing eliminating the source of the problem.
2. Avoidance behavior: You prioritize escaping the current predicament, or use avoidant methods as the way to solve the problem.
3. Memory loss: Your thoughts cannot form a line; you cannot rationally recognize the current situation, or you develop poor memory.
4. Fainting: Your vision is almost completely black, and your consciousness is left with only the final thread, until the madness ends.
5. Hysteria: You scream, laugh loudly, cry, or feel fear; suppressed emotions burst out, possibly bringing a fear effect.
6. Paranoia: You choose one thing you care about most and consider most important right now; before the madness ends, only this remains in your eyes.
7. Pseudo-disability: One part of your body loses its function under extreme pressure, for example movement speed halved, Strength-related Rolls -2 unfavorable, blinded, and similar effects.
8. Interpersonal dependence: You act to prioritize protecting the person closest to you on the scene; if none, protect yourself.

> GM Note: Madness symptoms follow the COC madness list.

## Mental Hardening

If you have long-term suffered a certain amount of Sanity / Rationality loss, then weaker Sanity / Rationality shocks have less impact on you.

- As long as you have suffered the corresponding mythic shock at least 3 times, then when you suffer weaker Sanity / Rationality loss than this (excluding advancement), the final Sanity / Rationality loss value is by default -1, to a minimum of 0.
- Mental Hardening is permanently effective, provided that after suffering that many corresponding mythic shocks, you have not died.

## Witnessing Mythical Runes

Whenever you witness any being that displays a Mythical Creature form, it causes Sanity / Rationality loss.

In addition, you gain the corresponding knowledge contained within the Mythical Runes, but:
- This is limited to beings starting from Sequence 4.
- Out-of-Control Beyonders before Sequence 4 are not included.

### Sanity / Rationality Loss List

| Situation | Loss |
|---|---|
| Witnessing mid/low-Sequence Out-of-Control Beyonders | 0/1. Starting from Sequence 4, you do not suffer Sanity / Rationality loss, and you will not gain knowledge. |
| Witnessing a Mythical Rune 1 Rank higher than yourself | 1d8/2d8; Sanity / Rationality loss Roll is +4 unfavorable. |
| Witnessing a Mythical Rune 2 Ranks higher than yourself | 1d12/2d12; Sanity / Rationality loss Roll is +6 unfavorable. |
| Witnessing a Mythical Rune 3 Ranks higher than yourself | 2d12/3d12. |
| Witnessing a Mythical Rune 4 Ranks higher than yourself | 3d10/4d10. |

[[UNCLEAR: This entry conflicts with the preceding general rule that witnessing Mythical Creature form causes loss and that knowledge is gained starting at Sequence 4; confirm what applies when witnessing a Sequence 4+ out-of-control being.]]

From the following onward, if you witness Mythical Runes with no protection, you are by default immediately Out-of-Control / dead:
- Witnessing a Mythical Rune 3 Ranks higher than yourself.
- Witnessing a Mythical Rune 4 Ranks higher than yourself.

[[UNCLEAR: The text assigns loss values for 3-4 Ranks higher but also states that witnessing with no protection is by default immediately Out-of-Control/dead; confirm when to apply the listed loss values.]]

**Special:**
- Between Sequence 4 and Sequence 3, witnessing incomplete mythos to each other does not cause Sanity / Rationality loss.
- Starting from Sequence 2, witnessing other Mythical Runes no longer causes Sanity / Rationality loss.

### Gaining Mythic Knowledge

Whenever you witness a Mythical Rune, you immediately gain the corresponding knowledge. It cannot exceed the known scope of the Mythical Rune's owner.

Roll 1d4 three times to determine the types of knowledge you gain:

| d4 | Knowledge gained |
|---|---|
| 1 | Partial intelligence about the corresponding Pathway: knowledge information that has not been concealed / anti-divined. |
| 2 | Potion formulae of the corresponding Pathway: gain 1d2 formulae. For high-Sequence formulae, a Difficulty Value 20 Luck check determines whether the formula is complete or only a part of it. |
| 3 | The Mythical Rune owner's name / alias / personality / stance: roll 1d4 to determine which one. |
| 4 | Ritual knowledge / Beyonder Abilities usage techniques / other knowledge held by the Mythical Rune owner, as determined by the GM. |

This only applies to a single instance of witnessing:
- You will not gain duplicate information.
- If duplicate information appears, you may reroll.
- Repeatedly witnessing may result in duplicate information.
