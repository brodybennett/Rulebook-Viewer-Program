# Acting

**Acting** is a method for digesting a potion and mastering its power. See also [[LINK LATER: Acting Method and Digestion | type=rule | hint=digestion overview]].

## Learning the Acting Method

A low-**Sequence** wild **Beyonder** usually has no way to know the **Acting Method**. Even official **Sequence** 9-7 Beyonders are usually the same.

> **GM Note:** If a character is in a tier where Acting matters, they must find a way to learn the Acting Method to digest their potion effectively, or you may establish (in their backstory) the channel through which they learned it.

## What Acting Is

**Acting** means: based on the performance implied by the potion's name, you place yourself into that role to align with the power the potion brings.

Examples:
- A **Sequence** 7 Psychiatrist helps others with psychological treatment.
- A **Sequence** 9 Seer goes to places like divination clubs to help others with divination.

During Acting, you must act immersively to gain recognition from the Beyonder characteristics within you - this is the essence of Acting - but you must not forget that "you are only acting."

> **GM Note:** If you truly treat the acted identity as yourself, you are very likely to gradually fall into the abyss of Loss of Control.

## Digestion Percentage

**Digestion %** is the potion progress gradually mastered through Acting.

- **Cap:** The Digestion % of a single potion can reach at most **20**.
- **After advancement:** After each advancement, if you did not **Act in Advance**, the potion's initial Digestion % is **1**.

### Digestion Benefits

For every **5** points of Digestion %:
- Your **Vitality** maximum **+1**.
- Your **Spirituality** maximum **+1**.

Potions of repeated **Sequence** levels are not counted.

### Potion Fully Digested

When a potion is fully digested:
- An illusory shattering sound rings beside your ears.
- You feel something within your body dissolving and merging with your mind.

This confirms you have completely digested the potion.

## Increasing Digestion %

There are two ways to increase a Beyonder's Acting progress.

### Daily Acting

**Daily Acting** means consistently performing the role implied by your potion (e.g., a "Faceless" constantly performing a persona not belonging to their original identity, or a Psychiatrist constantly providing daily treatment).

Gain **+1 Digestion %** for each period of Daily Acting:

| Sequence | Time per +1 Digestion % |
|---|---|
| Sequence 9 | 1 week |
| Sequence 8 | 2 weeks |
| Sequence 7 | 1 month |
| Sequence 6 | 3 months |
| Sequence 5 | Half a year |
| Sequence 4 | 1 year |
| Sequence 3 | 3 years |
| Sequence 2 | 6 years |
| Sequence 1 | 15 years |

(Sequence 0 is still judged as **Sequence 1** for this purpose, because Sequence 0 is essentially digesting three portions of Sequence 1 characteristics; however, the characteristics that need to be digested are obviously more than one portion.)

### Decisive Acting Feedback

**Decisive Acting Feedback** usually means you completed something related to Acting that is difficult and gains recognition, such as:
- others' recognition,
- summarized precise Acting rules,
- broad recognition from others,
- acknowledgement from one Beyonder of higher Rank than you, or from multiple Beyonders higher by **Sequence** level.

Apply the result to the potion matching your Acting name:

- If you are normally doing **Daily Acting**: increase Digestion % by **1d6** each time you complete a decisive Acting.
- If you are not normally doing **Daily Acting**: increase Digestion % by **1d4** each time.

## Acting in Advance

You can **Act in Advance** for a future potion or role.

- Example: A **Sequence** 9 Seer can Act in Advance for **Sequence** 6 Faceless.
- After you advance to that **Sequence**, you directly inherit the Digestion % you gained from Acting in Advance.
- Digestion % gained from Acting in Advance **before** you truly advance grants **no benefits**.

Acting in Advance is slower:
- The Acting speed is **half** of formal Acting.
- For **Daily Acting**, double the required time.
- For **Decisive Acting Feedback**: **1d6 -> 1d3** and **1d4 -> 1d2**.

## If You Do Not Act

If you are **not Acting at all**, the digestion time for Beyonder characteristics is:

| Sequence | Time per +1 Digestion % |
|---|---|
| Sequence 9 | 2 months |
| Sequence 8 | 6 months |
| Sequence 7 | 10 months |
| Sequence 6 | 2 years |
| Sequence 5 | 5 years |
| Sequence 4 | 20 years |
| Sequence 3 | 40 years |
| Sequence 2 | 80 years |
| Sequence 1 | 200 years |

The Digestion % benefits from not Acting **do not overlap** with Digestion % benefits from Acting.

- If you have already chosen to Act, you cannot gain Digestion % from not Acting.
- Example: If you Acted for 3 weeks, you do **not** also gain +1 Digestion % at the 2-month mark.
