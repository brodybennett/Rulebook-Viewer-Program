# Spirituality and Beyonder Abilities

This section covers recovery for **Spirituality**, **Vitality**, and **Sanity / Rationality** after exertion and injury.

> **GM Note:** After a fierce battle, characters will often have heavily reduced Spirituality and some Vitality loss; in special circumstances, Sanity / Rationality can also be exhausted into madness. Small differences in remaining Spirituality can significantly change the direction of a session.

## Spirituality Recovery

**Spirituality** recovers through sleep, meditation, or other **sufficient rest**. During sufficient rest, you cannot engage in intense exercise; you may walk, but you cannot run, fight, or hunt enemies.

- **8 hours** of sufficient rest fully restores your Spirituality.
- If you rest **less than 8 hours**, each hour restores **one-eighth of your Spirituality maximum**, **rounded down**.

For a rest period **shorter than 1 hour**, use the following:

| Rest Time | Recovery |
|---|---|
| Shortfall within **5 minutes** of 1 hour | The GM may decide it is approximately equal to **1 hour**. |
| More than **5 minutes** short of 1 hour, but you have already rested for **30 minutes** | Recover **half** of one-eighth of your Spirituality maximum. |

For rest periods **under 30 minutes**, recover **one-quarter** of the 1-hour recovery amount.

**Warning:** If your Spirituality is emptied, and **Beyonder** abilities continue to be forcibly used, it begins to consume your **Sanity / Rationality**.

**Special (example: [[Night Pathway]]):** Some effects reduce the rest duration needed for full Spirituality recovery. In such cases, each hour restores **(total Spirituality / maximum rest time)**. Example: if **3 hours** of sufficient rest is the maximum rest time, you restore **one-third** per hour.

Rounding for this formula: **round up**.

## Vitality Recovery

### Requirements

**Vitality** recovery requires sufficient recuperation (not necessarily sleep or meditation), and the injury must be properly handled. To recover Vitality, your wounds must have received corresponding medical treatment, been medically handled and cared for, and been protected from worsening or secondary injury.

> **GM Note:** Healing time references: ordinary wounds often take **1-2 weeks**; moderate injuries **1 month**; fractures and similar injuries **3 months**.

### Recovery Rate

| Condition | Recovery |
|---|---|
| Wound has undergone **1 successful Medicine Roll** treatment | Every **12 hours**, recover Vitality equal to your **Constitution (CON)**. |
| Wound has **not** undergone a Medicine Roll treatment | Every **12 hours**, recover Vitality equal to **half** your Constitution (CON), **rounded down**. |

### Medicine Difficulty Values

**Medicine Roll** Difficulty Values for different injuries:

| Injury Severity | Examples | Difficulty Value |
|---|---|---:|
| Minor injury | Abrasion, torso bleeding, rib fracture, injuries where you can still barely move | 10 |
| Moderate injury | Flesh torn open, a limb with large-area damage, moderate fracture | 15 |
| Severe injury | Near death, paralysis of the lower body, large-area full-body damage | 20 |

**Reference for Vitality loss (injury severity):**
- Minor injury: loses **within half** of total Vitality.
- Moderate injury: loses **more than half**, **rounded down**.
- Severe injury: near-death state, or remaining Vitality is **less than 2** points.

### Continued Treatment

1. A successful **Medicine Roll** grants a **24-hour treatment window**. During that window, the patient recovers Vitality equal to **Constitution (CON)** every **12 hours** (up to two recovery ticks). After **24 hours**, make **1 more** successful Medicine Roll (for changing medicine or re-bandaging); otherwise, recovery reverts to **half** Constitution (CON) per **12 hours**.
2. For **ordinary people**, with **moderate injury**, **severe injury**, or **fractures**: the **first** Medicine Roll cannot restore Vitality; it can only prevent the situation from worsening. You must be in a hospital with a suitable medical environment (or similar), then make **1 more** successful Medicine Roll to restore Vitality.
3. For **Beyonders**: only **severe injuries** require the special treatment in (2). **Sequence 4 and above** Beyonders do not need special treatment (see [[Chapter 10: Sequences]]). Even so, for a Beyonder to gain this benefit, within their Sequence there must be some Sequence level that provides a **Constitution (CON)** increase.
For **Beyonders**, the Sequence-level CON increase requirement gates the **Sequence 4+ exemption** in (3).

### Poison and Toxins

- Poison damage without external wounds must be handled by taking medicine that can deal with toxins.
- If the medicine taken is a **Beyonder** medicine, **no Medicine Roll** is needed.
- If it is an ordinary medicine, replace the Medicine Roll with a **Constitution (CON) Roll** of the corresponding Difficulty Value.
- The Witch's plague is calculated separately in the corresponding Sequence description (see [[Witch's plague]]).

## Sanity / Rationality Recovery

There are multiple channels to recover **Sanity / Rationality**. Common ones include psychological guidance, sufficient rest, and entertainment.

You may use methods (1), (2), and (3) within the same 24 hours (recovering a total of **3** points). The 24-hour limits are tracked **independently** for each method.

### Psychological Guidance

- Set the Difficulty Value to: **10 + the total Sanity / Rationality you have lost**.
- Each time you receive at least **2 hours** of psychotherapy, the Psychiatrist treating you makes **1** Psychological Guidance Roll against that Difficulty Value.
  - On success, you recover **1** point of Sanity / Rationality.
- You may attempt multiple times until success, but you can only recover **once per 24 hours** this way.
- Special: For [[Spectator Pathway]] Beyonders, psychotherapy time is **1 hour**; starting at **Sequence 7** it is **half an hour**.

### Rest

- If you take **8 hours** of sufficient rest, you recover **1** point of Sanity / Rationality.
- If less than **8 hours**, you may make up sleep within **12 hours**.
- After you gain this recovery, you cannot gain it again within **24 hours**.

### Entertainment

- If you engage in at least **2 hours** of entertainment behavior, you recover **1** point of Sanity / Rationality.
- The entertainment depends on your values, but it must bring sufficient happiness.
- Limited to recovering **once per 24 hours**.
