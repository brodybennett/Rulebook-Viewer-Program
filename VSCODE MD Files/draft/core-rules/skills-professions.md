# Chapter 4: Trained Skills and Professions

## Skill Levels and Modifiers

Skills use **Skill Levels**. Most rules reference the **Skill Modifier** below.

| Skill Level | Modifier |
|---|---:|
| **Untrained** | -4 |
| **Trained** | +2 |
| **Proficient** | +4 |
| **Advanced** | +5 |
| **Expert** | +6 |
| **Scholar** | +7 |
| **Master** | +8 |

Level-to-level increases:
- Trained: +2
- Proficient: +2
- Advanced: +1
- Expert: +1
- Scholar: +1
- Master: +1

## Character Creation Skill Allocation

During character creation, allocate starting Skills using **Intuition (INT)** and **Education**.

- **Dodge** starts at **Trained** by default.
- Choose a number of Skills equal to your **Intuition (INT)** to be **Trained**. Example: If your initial Intuition (INT) is 6, choose 6 Skills to be Trained.
- Choose a number of **professional Skills** equal to your **Education** to be **Proficient**. Example: If your initial Education is 6, choose 6 professional Skills to be Proficient.
- Increases to Education or Intuition (INT) from potions cannot be used to add starting Skills (unless a potion explicitly says otherwise). See [[Potions and Advancement]].

### Skill Slot Conversion

- Split **one Proficient** Skill gained from Education into **two Trained** Skills.
- Combine **two Trained** Skills gained from Intuition (INT) into **one Proficient** Skill.

> **Lore:** This represents spending more time specializing in that field.

### Skill Slot Stacking and Exceptions

**Default (no stacking):** Skills chosen via Intuition (INT) and Education cannot stack. You cannot spend 1 Intuition (INT) Skill slot and 1 Education Skill slot to make one Skill start at a higher level. Example: If you used Education to choose a **Proficient** Skill, you cannot spend Intuition (INT) to make it **Advanced**, unless the GM allows it.

**Exception: Reputation (stacking allowed):** Using **1 Education** can raise **Reputation** to **Proficient**. Then, using **1 Intuition (INT)**, Reputation can start at **Advanced**, and is allowed to stack further up to **Expert**, **Scholar**, and **Master**.

> **Lore:** This reflects the possibility of a royal background, but Reputation does not automatically equal family wealth.

**Exception: Dodge (stacking allowed, GM discretion):** Using Education on Dodge can make it **Proficient**. With GM approval, selecting Dodge with Intuition (INT) can stack further up to **Master**, similar to Reputation (each INT slot = +1 Skill level).



> **GM Note:** If there is a special need, discuss with the GM. With GM approval, Skills may be allowed to stack to a higher extent, but the recommendation is to limit starting Skill Level to at most **Advanced**, or it may cause imbalance (potions' extra Skills are already sufficient).

### Skill Levels Above Master

After a Skill reaches **Master**, it can continue to increase in special circumstances (generally from potions or certain encounters).

- Levels above Master have no separate name.
- Each additional level still grants **+1**.
- Further increases are generally difficult.
- Total Skill bonus should **not exceed +10**.

## Professional Skills

**Professional Skills** are the fields your character is best at and most specialized in.

- Education-based Skill choices (the Skills you select to start at **Proficient**) must be **professional Skills**.
- Professional Skills do not have a fixed category; they depend on your character's background and focus.

> **Lore:** A character might be a merchant early in life and a pirate later; or a writer who becomes a doctor. In *Lord of Mysteries*, switching **Pathways** can also shift what counts as "professional."

When selecting professional Skills, consider whether the Skill is closely related to your character background and strong field. The intent of this limitation is to keep your background aligned with your actual capabilities.

## Skill Checks and Related Attributes

Most Skills have a **related attribute**. When you make a Skill check, roll **1d20 + Skill modifier + related attribute value**. The Skill modifier and related attribute value together are your bonus.

- Even if you are **Untrained**, a sufficiently high related attribute value can still allow success.
- Conversely, training and attributes can reinforce each other.

See [[Chapter 2: Checks]] and [[Chapter 3: Attributes]].

Skills are grouped by related attribute: Strength (STR), Agility (DEX), Intuition (INT), Education, Charisma (CHA).

**Luck** does not add to Skills (see Burn Luck below).

## Skills by Related Attribute

### Strength (STR) Skills

For these Skills, use **Strength (STR) + Skill**.

1. **Climbing:** Move on a wall using **half your Movement**, provided the wall has grooves/footholds and is not completely smooth.
2. **Throwing:** Grab an object and accurately hit something, or deal damage to a target (oppose **Physical Defense**). Range equals **2 x Strength (STR)**. If you throw an object larger than your own size category, it does **not** double.
3. **Fighting:** Make a melee attack (oppose the target's **Physical Defense**). Subskills include: Melee (fists or a small weapon; may dual-wield small weapons); Swordsmanship (medium weapons such as swords, knives, clubs); Polearms (spears, lances, staffs); Huge Weapons (greatswords, giant clubs, giant scythes); Special Operations (whips, chains, meteor hammers, and other rare weapons). Special: This Skill is relative; large creatures can use Fighting (Swordsmanship) to wield huge weapons unless the weapon is larger than they are.
4. **Intimidation:** Scare a target so they briefly obey your commands; oppose the target's **Willpower (WIL)** check.
5. **Jumping:** Jump forward or upward, or complete certain stunts.
6. **Animal Handling:** Train an animal and have it follow your commands; oppose the target's **Willpower (WIL)** check.

### Agility (DEX) Skills

For these Skills, use **Agility (DEX) + Skill**.

1. **Stealth:** Hide and move without alerting others.
2. **Sleight of Hand:** Deft finger actions (theft, transferring items, magic tricks, etc.).
3. **Swimming:** Move in water using **half your Movement**.
4. **Shooting:** Shoot a target with a firearm (oppose the target's **Physical Defense**). Subskills include: Handgun (revolvers and other small firearms); Rifle (rifles, steam rifles, and other high-damage heavy weapons); Shotgun (buckshot weapons with high power and high recoil); Crossbow (cannot ignore Physical Defense granted by Agility (DEX) and Dodge); Bow (cannot ignore Physical Defense granted by Agility (DEX) and Dodge). Bows are divided into shortbows and longbows: shortbows use Agility (DEX) and have half Strength damage dice; longbows use Strength (STR) and have full Strength damage dice.
5. **Artillery:** Operate cannons on ships or airships, etc.
6. **Lockpicking:** Open a lock; the lock cannot exceed your knowledge scope.
7. **Dodge:** Your Physical Defense gains additional value.
8. **Driving:** Generally used for driving carriages, riding horses, etc.
9. **Heavy Machinery:** Large equipment and large mechanical vehicles.

### Intuition (INT) Skills

For these Skills, use **Intuition (INT) + Skill**.

1. **Listen:** Notice movements around you and related information.
2. **Investigation:** Look for clues and useful objects.
3. **Mechanical Repair:** Repair a broken device or tool.
4. **Mysticism:** Recall occult content, or cast a spell to oppose the target's corresponding defenses.
5. **Psychology:** Infer mental state; judge lies; observe speech and behavior.
6. **Cooking:** Cook food; identify chemical components in food; harvest edible parts from creatures.
7. **Art:** Literal arts. Subskills include: Singing (chant/sing the corresponding piece; not writing lyrics); Music Theory (reading sheet music, intervals, chords, rhythm, meter, advanced harmony, counterpoint, musical form, melody, orchestration); Painting (draw what you want using sketching); Crafting (produce handmade products by hand or with tools that are practical and aesthetically pleasing, may convey cultural meaning, and may have religious or social symbolic importance).
8. **Track:** Locate a target's direction based on traces.
9. **Lip Reading:** Without making a sound, understand what someone intends to say based on mouth shape.

### Education Skills

For these Skills, use **Education + Skill**.

1. **Navigation:** Use learned knowledge to find directions.
2. **Trade:** Appraise an item, or sell goods.
3. **Medicine:** Determine a corpse's cause of death, and treat teammates.
4. **Library Use:** Find the knowledge and content you need in a place with many books.
5. **Writing:** Use accumulated knowledge to write and organize language.
6. **Demolitions:** Use demolition knowledge to make an explosion achieve the effect you want (without causing collapse, etc.).
7. **Survival:** Avoid danger in the wild, find food, and identify whether food is poisonous; the GM sets **Difficulty Value** based on the environment.
8. **Knowledge (specialty):** Choose a specialty; you understand professional knowledge within it. Common examples:

| Specialty | Description |
|---|---|
| **Law** | Check whether a contract has anomalies, or recall legal knowledge. |
| **Archaeology** | Excavate relics, examine an item's age, identify relatively primitive/backward traps. |
| **Religion** | Knowledge related to religion. |

| **Biology** | Study living things (structure, function, origin, development) and their environment. |
| **Pharmacy** | Study drug sources, processing, effects, analysis/identification, compounding/production/storage, and searching for (including synthesizing) new drugs. |
| **Sociology** | Infer local general customs and terrain; detailed results require **24 hours** of investigation. |
| **Astronomy** | Observe astronomical phenomena, summarize patterns, and find directions. |
| **Botany** | Judge a plant's state using botanical knowledge. |
| **Agriculture** | Produce food and industrial raw materials by cultivating animals and plants. |
| **History** | Recall historical knowledge and events (including social sciences, humanities, and natural sciences, etc.). |
| **Engineering** | Study application of natural sciences across industries; study general engineering laws and conduct improvement research. |

9. **Natural World:** Gain macro-level information about plants, minerals, animals, and ecosystems.
10. **Mysticism Languages:** You must use such a language to use Beyonder Abilities or obtain a deity's response.

| Language | Effects and Notes |
|---|---|
| **Hermes Language** | Weakly mobilizes natural forces; must be spoken aloud to take effect; will not trigger spiritual intuition. |
| **Ancient Hermes Language** | Directly mobilizes natural forces; silent recitation can also take effect; triggers spiritual intuition at the moment it takes effect. |
| **Ancient Feysac** | Fourth Epoch common language (a branch of Giant); effect is equivalent to Ancient Hermes Language. |
| **Giant** | Mobilizes natural forces; effect is equivalent to Ancient Hermes Language; relatively niche within Beyonder circles. |
| **Dragon Tongue** | Mobilizes natural forces; effect is equivalent to Ancient Hermes Language; relatively niche within Beyonder circles. |
| **Elvish** | Mobilizes natural forces; effect is equivalent to Ancient Hermes Language. Each word is meaning-rich, so sentences are very short; with **1 free action** you can say **3 sentences**; also relatively niche within Beyonder circles. |
| **Old One Tongue** | Chinese/English, etc. In theory these can also mobilize natural forces, limited to transmigrators/special cases. |

Default range within which Mysticism Languages trigger spiritual intuition is within **100 meters**; the range in dreams does not affect real distance.

11. **Common Languages:** "Common" here specifically refers to everyday languages during the Fifth Epoch Black Iron Age.

| Language | Notes |
|---|---|
| **Loen** | Common language of the Loen Kingdom; evolved from Ancient Feysac. |
| **Intis** | Common language of the Intis Republic; evolved from Ancient Feysac. |
| **Feysac** | Common language of the Feysac Empire; evolved from Ancient Feysac. |
| **Dutan** | Common language of East/West Bayram in the Southern Continent; did not evolve from Ancient Feysac, but shares an origin with other languages. |
| **Highland** | Original language of the Southern Continent; does not originate from Ancient Feysac; has its own structure. |

Regarding **mother tongue**:
- You may freely choose **1 non-Mysticism** language to reach **Expert** as your mother tongue (or most proficient language).
- If you were born traveling back and forth between two countries, you may instead have **two languages at Proficient**.
- If you are an elf, giant, descendant of a Fourth Epoch angel family, etc., then your mother tongue may be the corresponding Mysticism Language.

#### Additional Rules for Education

Considering the completeness of the Black Iron Age education system, when your **initial Education** reaches the corresponding level:

| Initial Education | Benefit |
|---:|---|
| 1 | No increase; **Endure** checks penalty **-2** |
| 2 | No increase |
| 3 | You may additionally choose **1 Knowledge specialty** as Trained |
| 4 | You may additionally choose **2 Knowledge specialties** as Trained |
| 5 | On top of level 4, additionally choose **1** as Proficient |
| 6 | On top of level 5, additionally choose **1** as Proficient |

### Charisma (CHA) Skills

For these Skills, use **Charisma (CHA) + Skill**.

1. **Charm:** Increase a creature's favorability toward you.
2. **Deception:** Deceive through body language or speech, etc.
3. **Fast Talk:** Use techniques so the target does not notice details and is guided in the direction you want.
4. **Persuade:** Persuade the target so they believe your opinion is correct.
5. **Psychological Guidance:** Two uses: Hypnosis (make a friendly creature fall asleep and answer some questions) and Psychological Therapy (spend about **1 month** to restore a creature's **Sanity / Rationality**).
6. **Performance:** Publicly reproduce works (playing music, performing scripts, reciting poetry, etc.), directly or with equipment, using voice, expression, and movement; includes improvisation and free expression techniques.
7. **Disguise:** Use props to dress up as various identities according to different styles and characteristics.
8. **Reputation:** Make others believe your promises, and determine your economic level.

#### Reputation

The table below calculates **Reputation's base level** only. The **Charisma (CHA)** bonus only applies when making others believe your words, or when borrowing money and shopping.

| Reputation (Base) | Description |
|---:|---|
| 0 | Poor - only ~20 suleys, or even penniless. |
| 2 | Normal person level; can probably produce about 5 pounds. |
| 4 | Rich - can produce about 100 pounds. |
| 5 | Very rich; can probably produce a few hundred pounds. |
| 6 | Wealthy merchant - can produce several thousand pounds. |
| 7 | Noble; everyday assets close to ten thousand pounds. |
| 8 | Top-tier royal family or monarch; can casually spend tens of thousands of pounds. |

Note: Reputation value does not represent your family background. Even if your Reputation is only 2, you can still be a noble.

> **Lore:** Family assets usually do not represent personal assets. Reputation represents your usual disposable personal funds; you might be able to request more from family, but it may not be approved.

## Burn Luck

The **Luck** attribute does not add to Skills, because Luck is universal.

**Burn Luck:**
- Burning Luck is **1 free action**.
- Within each **24 hours**, you can only burn once.
- Choose any value, subtract it from your Luck, and add it to **1 basic Skill check**. This value cannot exceed the Luck you have.
- This does not change the results of **Critical Success** or **Critical Failure**.
- Burned Luck recovers at a rate of **1 point per 24 hours**.
- Luck cannot be lower than **0**.

Unique Fate Pathway changes: Increasing the number of uses and changing Critical Failure are unique to the Fate Pathway. See [[Fate Pathway]].

## Changing a Skill's Related Attribute

In some cases, a Skill's related attribute may change.

Example: Performance is normally Charisma (CHA)-related, but sometimes Performance may become Intuition (INT)-related (e.g., relying on superb acting rather than appearance). Some Beyonder Abilities already do this (e.g., Law is an Education-related specialty Skill, but when a Sequence 6 Judge uses related abilities, it uses "Intuition (INT) + Law" rather than "Education + Law").

A player may proactively roleplay this approach (e.g., "I want to use acting rather than appearance to win his approval."). This requires the GM's acknowledgment and consent; only then does the related attribute change take effect.

## Skill Growth

**Skill Growth** improves a Skill's level by receiving instruction, attending classes, or conducting research; this takes a relatively long time.

The timelines below assume:
- You can obtain appropriate mentorship/instruction, or have a sufficient research environment.
- If you improve a skill through **self-study** (research rather than instruction), the required time **doubles**.

### Study Durations by Instruction Frequency

**Tier I:** At least 2 hours of non-redundant, effective instruction on **6-7 days** within a week.

| Improvement | Time Required |
|---|---|
| Untrained -> Trained | 1 week |
| Trained -> Proficient | +1 month |
| Proficient -> Advanced | +3 months |
| Advanced -> Expert | +6 months |
| Expert -> Scholar | +1 year |
| Scholar -> Master | +5 years |

**Tier II:** At least 2 hours of non-redundant, effective instruction on **3-5 days** within a week.

| Improvement | Time Required |
|---|---|
| Untrained -> Trained | 2 weeks |
| Trained -> Proficient | +2 months |
| Proficient -> Advanced | +5 months |
| Advanced -> Expert | +8 months |
| Expert -> Scholar | +1.5 years |
| Scholar -> Master | +7 years |

**Tier III:** At least 2 hours of non-redundant, effective instruction on **1-2 days** within a week.

| Improvement | Time Required |
|---|---|
| Untrained -> Trained | 1 month |
| Trained -> Proficient | +5 months |
| Proficient -> Advanced | +10 months |
| Advanced -> Expert | +2 years |
| Expert -> Scholar | +5 years |
| Scholar -> Master | +10 years |

Notes: This is the speed of Skill improvement **without using potions**; generally, it cannot exceed **Master**.

**Special (Intuition learning bonus):** For every **6 points** of Intuition (INT) you have, your learning effectiveness increases by **one tier**. This means Tier III durations give Tier II results, Tier II give Tier I results, and so on by analogy. This can at most improve to **halving** the required time of Tier I. The shortest possible schedule is: in **1 week**, you have at least **2 hours** of study time.

### Study Limitation

- Study is limited to **once per day**.
- Deliberately increasing study intensity is not conducive to digesting knowledge.
- This slow growth and the rapid growth brought by potions are calculated independently; study done for rapid growth does not count toward the growth requirements of slow growth.

## Linked Skill Advancement

For Skills that are related to each other, their Skill Levels create linkage effects (**Linked Skill Advancement**).

How it works:
- If one Skill in a linkage reaches **Advanced**, the other linked Skills in that linkage increase by **1 level** (to a maximum of **Proficient**).
- If it reaches **Expert**, the other linked Skills increase by **1 level** again (still cannot exceed **Proficient**).

Example: If "Fighting (Swordsmanship)" reaches **Advanced**, then "Fighting (Melee)" and "Fighting (Special Operations)," etc., increase by **1 level** (reaching Trained). If it reaches **Expert**, they further reach **Proficient**.

### List of Linked Skills

For each linkage below, each time one item reaches Advanced/Expert, the other linked Skills can all increase by 1 level, and cannot exceed Proficient.

1. **Fighting Linkage:** Fighting (Melee), Fighting (Swordsmanship), Fighting (Polearms), Fighting (Huge Weapons), Fighting (Special Operations).
2. **Firearms Linkage:** Shooting (Handgun), Shooting (Rifle), Shooting (Shotgun).
3. **Bow/Arrow Linkage:** Shooting (Bow), Shooting (Crossbow).
4. **Social Linkage:** Charm, Fast Talk, Persuade, Deception, Intimidation, Psychology.
5. **Psychology Linkage:** Psychology, Psychological Guidance.
6. **Potion Linkage:** Chemistry, Pharmacy.
7. **Mysticism Linkage:** Mysticism, Religion, Hermes Language, Ancient Hermes Language, Ancient Feysac, Dragon Tongue, Giant, Elvish.
8. **History Linkage:** History, Archaeology.
9. **Language Linkage (Northern Continent):** Loen, Intis, Feysac, Ancient Feysac.
10. **Language Linkage (Southern Continent):** Dutan, Highland.
11. **Investigation Linkage:** Investigation, Lip Reading, Psychology, Track.
12. **Astronomy Linkage:** Navigation, Astronomy, Astrology.
13. **Mechanics Linkage:** Crafting/Manufacturing, Mechanical Repair.
14. **Medicine Linkage:** Medicine, Pharmacy, Biology. Improving Biology alone cannot link to Medicine or Pharmacy; this is a single-item linkage.
15. **Natural World Linkage:** Agriculture, Botany, Biology, Natural World.
16. **Music Theory Linkage:** Performance technique for relevant instruments, Music Theory, Singing. Singing or instrument performance technique can link to Music Theory; this is a single-item linkage.
17. **Performance Linkage:** Performance, Disguise.
18. **Writing Linkage:** Library Use, Writing.

Linked skills are not necessarily limited to those listed above. Players may expand with custom special Skills not mentioned in the rulebook. When reasonable, with the GM's permission, a skill linkage may be added or created to improve skills.

## Education Growth

Attribute increases brought by potions usually do not include **Education**. Most potions grant qualification to better learn knowledge, but generally do not grant further benefits at the knowledge level. Aside from potions providing knowledge about newly obtained Mysticism-domain abilities so that you know how to use them, potions generally do not grant further benefits at the knowledge level.

Therefore, Education grows by this special rule.

**Breaking the Cap:** Unlike other attributes, Education's cap can be broken. In theory, learning has no end; but lifespan, experience, and exposure limit knowledge acquisition. Thus, being a Beyonder still gives a greater advantage when breaking the cap.

Increase Education:
1. For every **5 skills** that reach **Expert**: Education **+1**.
2. For every **3 skills** that reach **Scholar**: Education **+1**.
3. For every **2 skills** that reach **Master**: Education **+1**.

Notes:
- Newly gained Education cannot grant you additional skill points; it only increases your Education attribute.
- During character creation, Expert/Scholar/Master obtained by allocating your initial Intuition (INT) and initial Education points do **not** count toward the growth scope above. Only Expert and Scholar skills that you raise through your own study or potion-based learning can be included in the growth scope above.
