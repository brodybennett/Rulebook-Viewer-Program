# Special Actions

In combat, you may take special actions. For any special condition mentioned below, see [[Special Conditions]].

## Ambush

An **Ambush** is a battle suddenly initiated by the ambushing side against the ambushed side, provided the ambushing side has not been discovered.

### Pre-Combat Ambush

An ambush achieved before combat begins.

Effect: The ambushing side gains **1 Ambush Round** (see [[Chapter 6: Combat]]). The ambushing side gains **Advantage** and the ambushed side gains **Disadvantage** until the Ambush Round ends (see [[Advantage / Disadvantage]]). If, during the Ambush Round, the ambushing side is not noticed/detected and their exact position is not discovered, the ambushed side suffers **Caught Off Guard** (see [[Caught Off Guard]]).

### Mid-Combat Ambush

An ambush achieved after combat has already begun, via movement abilities such as flame-jump.

Example: jumping to an enemy's face when they did not expect it.

Effect: This brings your turn forward and grants Advantage/Disadvantage, but there is no Ambush Round.

### Invisibility Ambush

A type of mid-combat ambush.

A creature turns invisible during combat and then launches an ambush from an unpredictable position.

Effect: Same as a mid-combat ambush. Any ability that can hide oneself can do this.

### Inserted Ambush

When a battle has already begun, one or more creatures that have not yet joined the battle cause an ambush.

Effect: This is equivalent to suddenly inserting themselves into a battle where they originally had no position. They enjoy the same checks and benefits as a pre-combat ambush.

For deeper uses of ambush and advanced combination use, see Advanced Actions (Practical Examples of Special Actions).

## Spiritual Intuition

You use **Spiritual Intuition** to sense whether an action is correct, or whether danger lies ahead.

**Action:** None. This is passively triggered.

**Check:** 1 Intuition (INT) check, **Difficulty 25**.

**Effect:** It can help you sense danger, feel a sense of wrongness, or confirm whether something should be done. It can be regarded as a low-end version of divination. Anti-divination abilities can block Spiritual Intuition.

**Information gained on success:**
1. The information is usually vague.
2. The GM can only tell you that an action "should be done" or "is best not done," or that you "feel vaguely uneasy / a sense of wrongness."
3. It cannot tell you specifically why or where the danger or wrongness lies.

**Limits and use:**
1. This special action may be triggered by you requesting the GM to trigger it, or by the GM triggering it.
2. Repeatedly using Spiritual Intuition on the same matter only yields the same result.
3. If your first Spiritual Intuition check failed and you felt nothing, then checking several more times will also fail, even if you get a critical success, unless the situation turns or you obtain new clues.

### Spiritual Intuition in Mythos Events

If you encounter a Mythos form that you cannot witness (excluding out-of-control ones that have not reached demigodhood), your Spiritual Intuition is usually extremely strong.

| Rank Gap | Result |
|---|---|
| 1 Rank higher than you | Difficulty 10 Spiritual Intuition check to perceive. |
| 2 Ranks higher than you | Spiritual Intuition check succeeds by default. |

From **Sequence 2** onward, even witnessing higher-Rank targets usually will not have this situation; you can witness them normally. This ability is renamed **Divine Intuition**.

## Reveal Partial Mythos Markings

As a demigod or angel, you reveal part of your Mythos markings.

**Action:** 1 Swift Action.

**Requirement:** Only Beyonders from **Sequence 4** onward may use this.

**Special:** It does not cause the Sanity / Rationality loss from revealing a Mythos.

**Effect:**
1. Without revealing a Mythos form, choose a limb or body part. Only a portion of your body (while in normal appearance) surfaces runes that represent Mythos symbols.
2. Those who witness the runes immediately suffer a Mythos-witnessing check equal to the Rank gap between you. See [[Witnessing Mythical Runes]] or [[Chapter 11: Manifesting Mythical Creature Form]].
3. This is usually only applicable to targets at least 1 Rank below you. It does not apply to targets from **Sequence 2** onward, because from that stage onward they are all complete Mythos beings and can witness each other.

### Spiritual Intuition Reaction to Mythos Markings

Revealing Mythos runes does not necessarily mean a Sanity / Rationality check immediately occurs, because it may trigger the target's Spiritual Intuition reaction.

1. The target may make a Difficulty 10 Spiritual Intuition check to immediately perceive danger. If they respond by closing their eyes and refusing to look (or simply not looking at the revealed part), your action fails.
2. If your guidance is sufficiently cunning, this can be avoided. If you performed such guidance, the target may only make 1 normal Difficulty 25 Spiritual Intuition check. If it does not succeed, the target immediately suffers the corresponding Sanity / Rationality impact.
3. Sanity / Rationality impact from a Rank gap can affect the true body even through a marionette, but the final check value is halved, rounded up.

## Meditation

You adjust your thoughts and enter a meditative state to cultivate your mind or resist emotional effects.

While performing either type of meditation, you must (in your mind) sketch things that do not exist in the world to focus your attention.

### Full Meditation

**Action:** 1 Casting Action.

**During the action:** You are considered **Caught Off Guard** and you cannot take any other actions (see [[Caught Off Guard]]).

**After it ends:** Willpower (WIL) temporarily **+2**; Intuition (INT) temporarily **+1**; emotional effects on you are removed, but can be generated again.

**Special:** For highest-level taunt, extreme emotions, or emotional effects caused by targets more than 1 Rank above you, a single meditation can only halve the effect.

### Half Meditation

**Action:** 1 Swift Action.

**Maintenance:** Costs 1 Swift Action each round.

**Effects:** Willpower (WIL) temporarily **+1**. Emotional effects already generated on you are halved, rounded up. To fully calm them, you must perform Full Meditation. Newly generated emotions must be halved again with another 1 Swift Action.

**Special:** Half Meditation cannot reduce highest-level taunt, emotional effects caused by targets more than 1 Rank above you, or extreme emotional effects. It can calm ordinary emotional effects from targets at least 1 Rank below you.

## Grapple

You use your body to restrict an enemy's actions, making them hard to move.

**Action:** 1 Attack Action.

**Check:** Fighting contests Physical Defense, ignoring Armor.

**Success:** You grapple the target, causing them to enter the **Restrained** condition. See [[Restrained]].

**Additional rules:**
1. This usually also causes you to become Restrained as you are grappling them. Checks for both of you gain Advantage/Disadvantage.
2. Each time the grappled creature's turn arrives, they may (no action) make 1 Strength (STR) contest with you; on a success they break free.
3. While in a grapple, you and the grappled creature cannot take Attack or Move actions. However, on each of your turns, you may use Brawling contested against their Constitution (CON) and squeeze them with Strength, dealing damage equal to your Strength damage die. This is the only permitted Attack action. It cannot be used if the opposed Strength is halved.
4. You may grapple the target with one hand to restrict their movement. You may then take normal Attack actions, but your Strength contest check is halved as a result, rounded down. Changing the grapple posture from two-handed to one-handed is 1 Swift Action.

While grappling, both sides are Restrained; no additional advantage/disadvantage applies beyond the Restrained condition.

**Warning:** Some abilities that state "creatures standing together are treated as the same target" will injure both of you.

### Grappling with Size and Strength Differences

1. When the two grapplers have a 2-level size difference, the smaller side can only restrict the larger side from using Move actions. The larger side is still considered Restrained, but cannot be prevented from using Attack actions.
2. The larger side can grab any limb of the smaller side with one hand (not treated as a vital strike) to perform a grapple. Because this only grabs part of the body, it likewise can only restrict Move actions and impose Restrained, and cannot restrict Attack actions.
3. When the larger side one-hand grapples a limb of the smaller side, the check is not halved. Grappling the full body (restricting Attack actions) still halves the check. With a 4-level size difference, one-handed grappling does not halve the check when restricting the full body, and the smaller side cannot grapple.

**Special:** When Strength differs by a factor of two, the above size-difference effects also apply. The two can stack, i.e., treat it directly as a 4-level difference.

## Build-Up Aim

Before attacking, you pre-aim at the target or make a prediction to increase your success rate.

**Action:** 1 Swift Action.

**Use:** Used alongside any action that targets another person and requires a hit check contesting Physical Defense.

**Effect:** Your corresponding hit check gains a **+2** bonus.

**Special (consecutive attacks):** When making any consecutive attacks, each hit requires 1 Swift Action to aim. Example: If you aim a revolver at someone and fire three shots in a row, each shot must spend 1 Swift Action to gain the benefit.

## Double Strike

You use your fists or a short blade to make a second attack.

1. Used alongside 1 Attack Action; only when your weapon is fists or a short blade. You may change the linked attribute of the melee check from Strength (STR) to Agility (DEX) to perform Double Strike. Make the check twice using: `1d20 + Agility (DEX) + Fighting (Unarmed)` vs Physical Defense.
2. A series of small weapons such as short blades or darts can also be thrown to benefit from Double Strike, consuming the corresponding number of items.

Double Strike is still treated as occupying only 1 Attack Action; both attacks occur within a single Attack Action.

## Point-Blank Shooting

You strike the target with a firearm at extremely close range.

**Action:** 1 Attack Action.

**Requirement:** The target must be within 1 meter of you.

**Benefits (no Fast Dodge):** All three shots within your 1 Attack Action can gain the benefits of Build-Up Aim (no Swift Action required; cannot stack). The first attack check succeeds directly as long as it is greater than the target's Armor. See [[id:alias-fast-dodge|Fast Dodge]].

**Benefits (Fast Dodge):** As long as the target cannot dodge light or lightning, your first shot check ignores the Agility and Dodge values within their Physical Defense, and all three shot checks gain the benefits of Build-Up Aim (cannot stack). If the target can dodge light or lightning, then all three shots only gain the benefits of Build-Up Aim. See [[id:alias-fast-dodge|Fast Dodge]].

**Special:** If the enemy made an advance declaration and prepared in advance to dodge your point-blank shooting, you cannot gain the benefits.

## Improvised Cover

You snatch up nearby objects to block attacks, or dart behind obstacles that can block attacks.

**Option 1: Snatch an item**

**Action:** 1 Swift Action.

You pick up an object appropriate to your Strength (STR) and hold it in front of you. As long as attacks targeting you cannot bypass it, your Physical Defense gains the Armor bonus of that item.

**Option 2: Take cover behind an obstacle**

**Action:** 1 Move Action.

You hide behind any obstacle to gain Armor. If you hide behind a hard wall or similar, then unless the enemy has the ability to penetrate the wall, they cannot choose you as a target.

### Armor Provided by Objects

| Category | Examples | Armor Bonus |
|---|---|---:|
| Small-size items | Beer bottle; hard ordinary book; small stool; short blade | +2 |
| Small-medium items | Armchair; small round table; knives and swords | +3 |
| Medium items | Door; long table; gigantic weapon | +4 |
| Medium-large items | Bed; large cabinet; medium wall | +5 |
| Large items | Not-short wall; carriage | +6 |

**Additional rule:** Any object *other than weapons* that is made of hard metal: Armor **+2** additional.

### What You Can Pick Up (Strength Requirements)

1. Every 2 points of Strength equals 1 size category above that can be picked up. Picking up a large-size item requires Strength 10. Objects connected to the foundation (such as walls) still cannot be picked up unless your Strength is twice the required Strength.
2. Any object in the examples above made of metal requires an additional 2 points of Strength. Weapons are already accounted for and do not need this.
3. If your Strength does not meet the requirement, you must additionally make a Strength check with Difficulty **15 + (2 x its size level)**.
4. If, after gaining Armor, you are still hit by an attack, the object you used for protection is considered destroyed.
5. The weapon in your hand can also be used for improvised cover, but being hit means it is broken.

**Special:** If you hide behind a hard obstacle such as a wall, and the attacker's Strength has not reached the level needed to pick it up, you are considered unable to be chosen as a target; they must go around the obstacle to attack you.

**Wall destruction notes:** Firearms must reach shell-level to directly destroy a wall. A Sequence 4 Beyonder can do so by default. Otherwise, treat the wall's Armor x 5 as HP and Physical Defense 10; overflow damage is then separately contested against the person hiding behind it once more.

## Delay Action

You delay an action that you could take this round.

**Action type:** An Attack/Casting Action, but you delay this action.

**Choice:** Choose 1 action to delay: Free, Swift, Attack, Casting, or Move.

**Declaration:** You must make an advance declaration to the GM, specifying a timing within this round when you will use the delayed action.

Example: When your turn arrives, you declare that you do not act yet, delaying your turn until a teammate's turn to act together and achieve a coordinated effect.

Use cases for delayed conditions:

1. This addresses cases where a teammate grapples an enemy, but the next turn is not yours but the enemy teammate's turn, causing coordination to miss the best timing and possibly letting the enemy be rescued.
2. Delaying an action must declare a scenario in advance (e.g., when the target reaches a certain position or takes a certain action, you perform the delayed action). If the declared scenario does not occur, your action is still considered spent and the action is cancelled.

**Note:** A delayed action cannot be retained or carried over to the next round.

## Charge

You knock the target to the ground, causing them to lose balance.

**Action:** 1 Attack Action, possibly alongside 1 Move Action.

**Check:** Use your Strength (STR) to contest the charged creature's Strength or Agility (DEX) (representing standing firm or dodging).

**Success:** The target enters the **Off-Balance** condition. See [[Off-Balance]].

### Off-Balance

- Agility (DEX) is temporarily halved, rounded up, affecting movement speed and Physical Defense.
- The target needs 1 Move Action to stand up and regain balance.
- Before that, avoiding attacks can only be done by rolling to dodge.

## Borrow Strength Against Strength

You exploit a fatal mistake by an enemy who makes a close-range attack against you.

**Action:** 1 Attack Action.

**Target:** Choose 1 target that made a melee attack targeting you and rolled a critical failure.

Uses:

1. Only for targets where your Strength is not lower than theirs by 3 points, **or** where there is a 2-level build difference. You grab the wrist of their incoming strike and, with the momentum, flip them behind you. When they hit the ground, they take damage equal to **1d3 + Strength damage die**. The check succeeds by default. Special: If the target lacks a balance-type Beyonder ability, they must also make a Difficulty 20 Agility check. Otherwise, after landing they enter Off-Balance. If the Agility check is a critical failure, treat it as hitting their head; they enter **Stunned** for 1 round. See [[Stunned]].
2. If you do not use (1), you immediately apply the effect of 1 Attack Action to them; the check succeeds by default.
3. You cannot replace the attack check with 1 Casting Action, unless it is a wind-related Beyonder ability that can likewise flip them (using (1)). Otherwise it typically violates the intent of this special action.

## Leg Sweep

You use your legs rather than your hands to make a melee attack against the enemy.

1. Only usable when Agility (DEX) is 5-6 or higher.
2. Used alongside 1 Attack Action: use your legs and make a Fighting (Unarmed) check. Range is within your height/2, rounded down. You may choose up to 3 targets standing together.
3. Damage dealt is only half of your Strength damage die, rounded up. If your check is a critical failure, you lose balance.
4. If the enemy is willing, when you critically fail, they may use 1 Swift Action to do one of the following (replacing your loss of balance): make 1 one-handed Grapple against you, or use Borrow Strength Against Strength against you. In this case, the Strength damage die of Borrow Strength Against Strength is only half.
5. This cannot be Double Strike. Because legs do not have a weapon, you usually can only deal **1d3 + (half Strength damage die)** damage.

## Intimidate

You make a feint within close range against a creature, causing the enemy to instinctively dodge away.

**Action:** 1 Swift Action, once per round.

**Target:** Choose 1 target within 1 meter.

**Check:** Make an Intimidation check contested by a Willpower (WIL) check.

**Success:** The target must immediately take 1 Move Action to move away from you. If they have no Move Action, then when they next gain a Move Action (in the next round), they must do so.

## Flanking / Envelopment

You gain advantage by using numbers or tactics to surround the enemy.

| Condition | Effect |
|---|---|
| Your side's total number (counting only those already in the battle) is at least twice the enemy's | You continuously gain Advantage and the enemy continuously gains Disadvantage until your numbers fall below this value or the enemy leaves your zone of influence. |
| Either side has a presence 1 Rank higher (or higher) than the other side on the scene | That side continuously gains Advantage and the other continuously gains Disadvantage. |
| Either side blocks all exits or ways to escape the scene for the other side | Until the blockade is broken, that side continuously gains Advantage and the other continuously gains Disadvantage, even if your numbers are less than the enemy's. |
| A creature can unilaterally attack the target while the target has no means to attack it | That creature alone gains Advantage against the target, and the target gains Disadvantage against it. |

Determination after meeting conditions:

1. Meeting any one of the above grants the benefit of Advantage/Disadvantage.
2. If both sides meet some conditions, compare the number of conditions met to determine who has the Advantage, or whether neither side has Advantage/Disadvantage.
3. Even if a team meets multiple conditions, the granted Advantage/Disadvantage does not stack. The side that meets more conditions gains Advantage/Disadvantage.

Example: One team meets condition 3 by blocking all exits. The other team's numbers are at least twice as many (condition 1). The two cancel out and neither side gains any benefit.

## Feint

You use a feint to deceive the opponent, catching them off guard.

**Action:** 1 Swift Action.

**Check options:** Use a Deception or Performance check, or use a Brawling check at least at Proficiency level (melee only).

**Posture:** You must make a feigned attack or casting posture.

**Contest:** Against the target's Investigation or Intuition (INT).

**Success:** You feint a punch or fake casting, then suddenly make the real attack. Against targets that cannot Fast Dodge, your next attack causes them to enter **Caught Off Guard** (their Physical Defense cannot gain the bonuses from Dodge and Agility (DEX)). See [[Caught Off Guard]] and [[id:alias-fast-dodge|Fast Dodge]].

**Special:** This is an ambush, so it gains the benefits of Advantage/Disadvantage.

## First Aid

You administer first aid to a creature to curb its injuries.

**Action:** 1 Casting Action. If its HP is below half (rounded up), it instead requires 1 Full-Round Action.

**Effect:** Ends the following conditions on the target: Bloodbath, Bleeding, Poisoned (only poisoning caused by external wounds). See [[Bloodbath]], [[Bleeding]], and [[Poisoned]].

**Limits:** This does not restore HP. Before the creature gets 1 instance of adequate rest or leaves the corresponding injury, any damage type the same as the original will cause Bloodbath, Bleeding, Poisoned, and similar conditions to recur.

Example: A creature is in Bloodbath and receives first aid. Until its HP returns to more than half of its maximum HP, any attack will cause Bloodbath to occur again, even if the original damage was physical and the subsequent damage was toxin.

## Vital Strike

A **Vital Strike** is an Attack or Casting Action.

- You aim at the target's vital area to attack.
- Penalty: This attack check takes a **-10** penalty.
- Effect: Produces special effects depending on the body part.

Body part effects:

| Body Part | Effect |
|---|---|
| Head | Stuns for 1 round and deals an additional **2d6** damage. |
| Eyes | After successfully hitting twice, the target enters Blinded (see [[Blinded]]). |
| Ears | The target enters Deafened (see [[Deafened]]). |
| Arms | The target's Fighting attack checks **-2**. This effect can stack additively. |
| Legs | The target's movement speed is reduced by 50%. This effect can stack additively, reducing by 50% each time, but cannot make the target completely unable to move. |
| Internal organs | Deals an additional **3d6** damage. |

Removing negative conditions:

- The negative conditions from the above effects persist until receiving one instance of First Aid or medical treatment.
- Each First Aid or medical treatment can remove only 1 instance of effect. Example: If the eyes were hit by two vital strikes, two instances of First Aid or medical treatment are required to fully remove it.

Warning:

- If any single vital strike deals more than half of the target's maximum HP (rounded up) in damage at once, it will cause permanent or lingering injury.
- Any Beyonder who has gained a Constitution (CON) bonus from a potion can recover such injuries; treat it as recovering when HP is fully restored.

## Limb Block

You move a limb to block the opponent's vital strike.

**Action:** 1 Swift Action.

**Choice:** Choose one of your four limbs; you attempt to block one vital strike targeting you.

**Resolution:** Make an Agility (DEX) check contested against the opponent's check result. Only on a success do you block it.

**After a successful block:** Any vital strike targeting your other body parts is treated as having hit the limb you chose.

**Limits:** Each of your limbs can block like this once. If all have blocked once, you can no longer take this action.

**Special:** Unless you can dodge light or lightning, you are too slow to use Limb Block against firearms.

## Burn Luck

**Burn Luck** is 1 Free Action.

Core rule:

- You can Burn Luck only once per 24 hours.
- Choose an amount (up to your current Luck). Subtract that amount from your Luck and add the same amount to any 1 basic skill check.
- The added value cannot exceed the Luck you have.

Additional note: Additional uses and changing a critical failure are unique to the Fate Sequence; see [[Fate Pathway]] for details.

Warnings and limits:

- This does not change critical success and critical failure results.
- Burned Luck recovers at a rate of 1 point per 24 hours.
- Luck cannot be lower than 0.
- You may only Burn Luck for hit checks and similar checks, not for damage rolls or for specific Sanity / Rationality value rolls (e.g., the 1d3 rolled when losing 1d3 Sanity / Rationality).

> **GM Note:** Burning Luck may be allowed to affect Initiative and Sanity / Rationality checks (GM approval required). The text frames this as feasible in interpretation (chance or environment affecting performance), and gives an example that Burning Luck could, by chance, cause a character's line of sight to miss the most dangerous point.

## Advanced Actions (Practical Examples of Special Actions)

This section collects combination uses and edge-case clarifications, especially for Ambush.

### Ambush: Practical Clarifications

**Pathway interactions:** For some special Pathways (example given: Witch), Ambush may gain additional benefits. If you can become invisible during combat and thereby make the opponent unable to determine your position, you can Ambush again during combat. This kind of Ambush does not create an additional Ambush Round. It can be used for some Pathways' additional effects for Ambush, and you still gain the benefits of Advantage/Disadvantage.

**Position determined:** If the invisible combatant's position is judged to have been determined (e.g., the opponent succeeds at an Investigation check against invisibility), then the Ambush is considered a failure. It can only be treated as a normal attack or casting check during combat. The target who discovers the invisible character can also attack them even if the character is invisible. See [[Special Conditions]].

**Movement/teleport ambush timing:**
- If this action is the fuse that triggers combat, it can produce an Ambush Round.
- If it is used during combat, it can move your turn order earlier, forcibly inserting your action before the current actor, and you gain Advantage/Disadvantage. If the current actor has already begun executing a casting or attack action, that action (already halfway underway) is considered to be completed first by the turn owner.

**Duration and stacking in combat:**
- If the Ambush occurs during combat, the gained Advantage/Disadvantage can only last for that one Ambush check. For movement-type Ambushes, only the one immediate follow-up attack gains this benefit.
- If you are already in an Advantage/Disadvantage state produced by triggering an Ambush Round, further Advantage/Disadvantage gained from additional Ambushes cannot stack.
- Disadvantage case (as written): If you are the side that encountered an Ambush Round (i.e., the side with Disadvantage) and you perform an Ambush during combat, then for that one check only, both sides' Disadvantage and Advantage cancel each other only for that one check.

### Combat Ambush Using Obstacles

Even without invisibility or teleportation abilities, a combat Ambush can still be established.

Core idea: The essence of a combat Ambush is that you are not "seen" by others during combat (the opponent cannot determine your movements).

Obstacle example (mechanical takeaways):

1. You can use obstacles to block sight (example: lift a table) so the enemy cannot see you. This may be done using Improvised Cover and/or a simple Move Action, as appropriate.
2. If you have not yet used an Attack/Casting Action on your turn (and have one prepared/unused via your declared play), then when the enemy comes around the obstacle you may be considered to have prepared the strike in advance and may make the attack check for that prepared, unused, delayed Attack/Casting Action before their attack check.
3. If you have an extra Swift Action, the attack can also stack one Build-Up Aim.
4. You can also make one more check: your Stealth opposed by the target's Investigation. If successful, this check can additionally apply one layer of **Caught Off Guard** to the opponent (see [[Caught Off Guard]]).

Vital Strike limitation (as written): Because the obstacle blocks vision for both sides, you cannot pre-aim at vital points. These benefits cannot let you ignore the penalties from a Vital Strike. If you still want to perform a Vital Strike, at most the above benefits can only narrow the disadvantage caused by the Vital Strike; they cannot remove the negative special effect of the Vital Strike.

Reverse timing example (mechanical takeaway): If you do not have a reserved, unused Attack/Casting Action remaining, the enemy can attack you once first. If you are judged to have successfully performed an Ambush (based on your preparatory motion and the blocked vision), then that one attack of theirs gains Disadvantage, and they cannot pre-aim at you.
