# Weapon Examples

Investigators can choose the following weapons.

## Melee Weapons

**Melee Weapons** are weapons without gunpowder (or similar elements).

| Weapon | Damage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fists | **1d2 + Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** | — |
| Short Blade | **1d4 + Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** | — |
| Short Blade (Double Strike use) | **1d4 + half Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** (round up) | You can attack twice within 1 **Attack Action**, making two rolls. You must use the **Brawl (Melee) Skill**. See [[Double Strike]]. |
| Blades/Swords | **1d6 + Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** | — |
| Heavy Weapon | **1d8 + Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** | Can attack enemies within 1 meter without necessarily needing contact. |
| Whip | **1d2 + half Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** (round up) | Range: 1 meter. You can attack 3 times consecutively within 1 Attack Action: second roll **-4**, third roll **-6**. |
| Cane/Club (wooden) | **1d3 + Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** | — |
| Cane/Club (hard / silver-inlaid, etc.) | **1d4 + Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** | — |

| Shortbow | **1d3 + half Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** (round up) | Related attribute: Agility (DEX), not Strength (STR). Range equals your Strength (STR). |
| Longbow | **1d6 + Strength (STR) Damage Bonus** | Related attribute: Strength (STR). Range is twice your Strength (STR). |
| Hand Crossbow | **1d6** | Each bolt requires 1 **Swift Action** to reload. |
| Crossbow | **2d6** | Each bolt requires 1 **Full-Round Action** to reload. |

## Firearms

**Firearms** cause heavy damage via gunpowder (and similar substances) and are usually not directly related to the user's Strength (STR).

### Flintlocks

**Flintlock:** can load 1 bullet; reloading is 1 Full-Round Action.

| Weapon | Damage | Range |
|---|---|---|
| Flintlock Pistol | **1d4** bullet damage | 80 meters |
| Flintlock Rifle | **1d8** bullet damage | 150 meters |

### Revolvers

**Revolver:** can load 6 bullets; reloading is 1 Attack Action.

| Weapon | Damage | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Revolver | **1d6** bullet damage | 30 meters | Can fire 3 shots in a burst; each shot in the burst takes a **-2** penalty, increasing sequentially. |
| Custom Revolver | **1d6+2** bullet damage | 50 meters | Otherwise the same as a revolver; official or reputation-proficient may choose. |

### Rifles

Rifles: reloading is 1 Full-Round Action. (Because there are many types, different rifles have different loading/usage methods.)

| Weapon | Damage | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Bolt-Action Rifle | **2d6** bullet damage | 160 meters | Can load 5 bullets. Each shot requires 1 **Free Action** to work the bolt. |
| Semi-Automatic Rifle | **2d6** bullet damage | 160 meters | Same as bolt-action rifle, but no need to work the bolt. Can fire 3 shots in a burst; each shot in the burst takes a **-2** penalty, increasing sequentially. |

### Hunting Guns / Shotguns

Hunting Guns / Shotguns: reloading is 1 Full-Round Action; ammo capacity differs by weapon.

| Weapon | Damage | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Single-Barrel Hunting Gun | **2d6** bullet damage | 50 meters | Can load 1 slug. Affects all targets within the wound-direction area. |
| Double-Barrel Hunting Gun | **2d6** bullet damage | 50 meters | Based on the single-barrel hunting gun. Can load 2 slugs and fire them all at once, split into 2 rolls. |

### Shotgun Special Rules

Special: hunting guns and shotguns are the same category.

- If the roll result is greater than the target's **Physical Defense** (not counting Agility (DEX) and Dodge), even if the roll fails it still deals half damage.
- Within 10 meters of the target: damage increases by half; **Ignore Armor** by 2 points.
- Within 5 meters: damage doubles (round up); **Ignore Armor** by 3 points.
- If Ignore Armor exceeds the target's **Armor**, the excess becomes a Damage Bonus.

### Explosives

Explosives generally require the Throwing Skill to take effect; they are one-time consumables.

| Explosive | Damage | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Fragmentation Grenade | **2d6** explosive damage | Ignore Armor by 2 points; excess becomes a Damage Bonus. Affects a 5-meter radius. Each creature in the radius takes an additional **1d6** physical damage. |
| Demolition Grenade | **3d6** explosive damage | Ignore Armor by 3 points; otherwise the same as above. Affects a 5-meter radius. |
| Explosives / Detonator | **2d6** explosive damage | Ignore Armor by 3 points; otherwise the same as above. Affects a 5-meter radius. Generally placed somewhere and detonated. |
| Molotov Cocktail | **1d6** fire damage | Affects a 5-meter radius. At the start of each round, deals **1d6** fire damage, lasting up to 2 rounds. Use 1 **Move Action** to roll on the ground to extinguish the flames. |

### Heavy Weapons

Heavy weapons: reloading is 1 Full-Round Action.

> **GM Note:** Heavy weapons in *Lord of the Mysteries* are generally not a category used by players.

| Weapon | Damage | Range | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| Steam Rifle | **3d6** bullet damage | 200 meters | Can load 5 bullets; otherwise the same as a semi-automatic rifle. |
| Sniper Rifle | **3d6+5** bullet damage | 800 meters | Manual type can load 5 bullets; magazine is 10 bullets. |
| Shell | **4d6** explosive damage | 10,000 meters | Loads a single shell. Affects all targets within 10 meters of the impact point. |
| Coastal Defense Cannon | **5d6** explosive damage | 20,000 meters | Otherwise the same as shells. |

**Note:** "Bullet damage" and "explosive damage" are both physical damage in substance; they are just different intuitive labels.

Firearms and shells: all can ignore the Agility (DEX) and Dodge components in the target's Physical Defense value, not including targets with [[id:alias-quick-dodge|Quick Dodge]].

> **GM Note:** Shotguns usually require a hunting license to own, which usually requires the character to be at least reputation-proficient. Steam rifles can only be held by the military and the Steam Church; even police or official or background ownership may still involve illegal possession of firearms. If caught by the police, you will likely end up in a public security court unless you stated in advance that you picked it up and have sufficient reasons to prove why you might have gunpowder residue on you.

## Armor

**Armor** is used to resist damage and protect vital points; armor is made of different materials.

| Armor | Armor | Damage Reduction | Other Effects |
|---|---:|---|---|
| Padded Armor / Leather Armor | 2 | 2 points of physical **Damage Reduction** | Destroyed after taking fire damage twice. |
| Chainmail / Iron Armor | 4 | 3 points of physical and fire Damage Reduction | Agility (DEX) temporarily **-2** after wearing. |
| Half Armor | 6 | 4 points of physical and fire Damage Reduction | Agility (DEX) temporarily **-4**. If Strength (STR) is under 6, Movement speed is halved. If Strength (STR) is under 4, you cannot move. When **Vital Strike** targets the lower body, it does not provide protection. |
| Full Armor | 8 | 5 points of physical and fire Damage Reduction | Agility (DEX) temporarily **-4**. If Strength (STR) is under 10, Movement speed is halved (round up). If Strength (STR) is under 5, it cannot be worn. |
| Enchanted Full Armor | 8 | 5 points of external Damage Reduction | Agility (DEX) temporarily **-2**. If Strength (STR) is under 8, Movement speed is halved (round up). If Strength (STR) is under 4, you cannot move. |

External armor can only stack with [[Skin Armor]].

> **Lore:** Military or royal enchanted full armor is generally deep black with a metallic sheen. It is usually worn by the military or royal "Punishment Knights" when performing long-distance escort or guard missions, generally appearing in situations involving ironclad ships or war; it will not appear in other situations. (It is generally not seen in the center of a city, protecting unimportant persons or objects, or performing city-internal work.)
