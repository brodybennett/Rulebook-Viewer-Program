# Special Conditions

## Off-Balance

You are **Off-Balance** when you lose your balance and fall to the ground.

- You cannot perform **Move actions**.
- Your Agility (DEX) is temporarily halved (rounded up). This affects your **Movement** and **Physical Defense**.
- To stand up and regain balance, spend **1 Move Action**.
- Before you stand, dodging attacks can only be done by rolling to dodge.

## Helpless

You are **Helpless** when you lose all mental and physical capacity to resist.

- You have completely lost the ability to act. This may be passive fainting/death, or being unable to escape an overwhelmingly powerful enemy. The standard is whether you cannot even move at all.
- Attacking a helpless creature gains **Advantage**. See [[Advantage / Disadvantage]].
- A helpless creature is treated as being in the **Restrained** condition. Its **Physical Defense** cannot gain the numerical bonuses from Agility (DEX) and Dodge.
- If a helpless creature has no allies protecting it, then even making a **Vital Strike** against it has no Disadvantage.
- If a creature still has any means of resistance (and is not completely fainted or dead), even with only vague consciousness, it should **not** be treated as helpless.

## Silenced

You are **Silenced** when you cannot make any sound.

- While silenced, actions and **Beyonder Abilities** related to speech are treated as impossible to use.

> **Lore:** Silence may be caused by effects such as Decrees of the Arbiter Pathway.

## Restrained

You are **Restrained** when your body is fixed in place.

- You cannot perform **Move actions**.
- You lose the Agility (DEX) and Dodge-related values in your **Physical Defense**.

In some special cases, restraint may still allow limited movement:

- If you are restrained (e.g., tied up) but no one is controlling you, you might move slowly by hopping or wriggling.
  - Your **Movement** is treated as being equal only to your Strength.
  - You still do **not** regain the Agility (DEX) and Dodge values in your Physical Defense.

Restraint may also limit the use of special actions:

- For example, while Restrained you obviously cannot perform special actions such as limb blocks or grapples.

> **Lore:** Generally, Abyss Shackles, Dream Invasion, and similar effects are restraints that prevent even movement.

**Special:** When attacking an enemy in the Restrained condition, **Vital Strike** does not suffer Disadvantage.

## Caught Off Guard

You are **Caught Off Guard** when you suffer an attack outside your predicted range and do not notice the target, briefly unable to react.

- Your **Physical Defense** loses the Agility (DEX) and Dodge-related values.
- This is generally produced together with an unnoticed pre-combat ambush.
- **Full Meditation** can also cause you to enter the Caught Off Guard state; this is closer to being unable to dodge.

## Advantage / Disadvantage

**Advantage** and **Disadvantage** represent one side taking control of the fight.

**Prerequisite:** Advantage and Disadvantage generally can only be achieved through:
- Ambush
- Siege, encirclement, or flanking (see [[Special Actions]])

The GM may also expand trigger conditions based on circumstances.

When you gain Advantage or Disadvantage:

1. **Gain Advantage** (only for actions targeting enemies): your skill checks and attribute checks against enemies gain **+2 (favorable)**.
2. **Gain Disadvantage:** the Agility (DEX) and Dodge-related parts of your **Physical Defense** suffer **-2 (unfavorable)**.

Additional rules:

- Advantage and Disadvantage generally occur at the same time. If there is Advantage, there must be Disadvantage. If there is Disadvantage, there must be Advantage. There will basically not be a situation where only one side has it.

**Optional simplification (for ease of play):** Instead of tracking the Physical Defense reduction, you may treat the effect as the advantaged side gaining **+4 (favorable)** on checks against the disadvantaged side.

> **GM Note:** Because Disadvantage only reduces the Agility (DEX) and Dodge parts of Physical Defense, if an effect can fully ignore all Agility (DEX) and Dodge values, it should **not** gain the simplified +4 benefit. Use the simplification cautiously.

Trigger limitations and stacking:

- Special conditions such as **Blinded** or **Off-Balance** are **not** treated as trigger conditions for Advantage or Disadvantage, because their negative effects are themselves already a kind of Disadvantage.
- Advantage or Disadvantage can generally only be gained through ambush or encirclement.
- The Advantage or Disadvantage effect itself cannot stack.
- Conditions such as **Blinded** are not in the "cannot stack" category; the limitation is reflected in the trigger conditions above.

## Dazed

You are **Dazed** by overwhelming pressure; your actions are briefly impeded.

- For the duration, you lose either **1 Attack/Casting/Move Action** or **2 Swift Actions**.
- Which kind of action is lost is decided by you.
- The Dazed state cannot stack.
  - The "lose actions" effect can still stack with action-restricting abilities other than Dazed (e.g., the Puppet Master's Spirit Body Thread Manipulation), causing an enemy to lose even more actions.

## Stunned

You are **Stunned** when severe impact or disruption causes brief combat shutdown.

- You cannot take **Attack/Casting Actions** or **Move Actions**.
- You can perform at most **1 Swift Action**; Free Actions remain usable.
- If a source does not specify duration, Stunned lasts until the **end of your next turn**.
- Stunned cannot stack with itself; apply only the longest remaining duration.

## Blinded

You are **Blinded** when your eyes are completely blinded; you cannot see the surrounding environment.

1. Actions that target other things require a **Difficulty 15 Intuition (INT)** check to recall the direction; otherwise they cannot be performed.
   - If the other party's position has moved, then even if your action has already been performed, it may result in failure.
2. You can use a **Difficulty 15 Listening** check to confirm an enemy's position.
   - If the enemy has not moved, adjudicate using (1).
   - If the enemy has moved and intentionally concealed their sound, use **Listening opposed by their Stealth** check.
3. You normally cannot perform **Vital Strike**.
   - If you cannot locate the source of attacks targeting you, you are treated as Caught Off Guard.
4. If you are better at Intuition (INT), you may replace the Listening check with a **Spiritual Intuition** check (see [[Special Actions]]).

> **GM Note:** Sounds with a clear source (gunshots, shouts, screams, glass breaking, metal collisions) do not require a check to lock direction.

> **GM Note:** Ordinary flight or levitation achieved via a hurricane will also make sound. Spirit-type creatures' actions may not make sound, but a Spiritual Intuition check can be used to perceive their position.

## Deafened

You are **Deafened** when you cannot hear sounds.

- Your **Listening** checks automatically fail.
- When this effect involves hearing in a Beyonder sense, it usually can only **halve** the Listening check result (rounded up) (e.g., Sequence 8 Listener), unless the cause of deafness is also a Beyonder effect.

**Special:**
- Under the premise of being below Rank 1, deafness caused by **Beyonder Abilities** can only halve Beyonder-sense hearing checks and cannot completely nullify them.
- If the difference is two Ranks, it cannot deafen them.

## Invisible

You are **Invisible** by some means and are difficult to pinpoint.

1. Pinpointing an invisible creature's position requires an **Investigation** or **Listening** check opposed by its **Stealth** check. Otherwise, you are treated as unable to attack it. Area effects ignore invisibility as long as the invisible creature is within the affected area.
2. Spirit-type creatures do not make sound. You can only use a **Spiritual Intuition** check to perceive their position. If they intentionally conceal themselves, instead use an **Intuition (INT)** check opposed by their **Stealth** check.

The premise for any of the above checks is that you have realized the existence of an invisible creature. If you do not even know there is an invisible creature here, you cannot make checks to perceive its position.

> **Lore:** Even if a creature is invisible, it cannot completely conceal its interaction with the environment and the sounds it makes.

## Fear

You are in **Fear** when unparalleled fear fills your heart.

1. All checks related to the source of fear suffer **-4 (unfavorable)**.
2. Each of your **Move actions** can only move away from the source of fear.
   - Resisting this forced movement requires a **Difficulty 15 Willpower (WIL)** check.
   - Once you succeed, you no longer suffer the forced movement effect afterward, unless a new Fear effect is stacked onto you (then you must check again).
3. Even if you resist the forced movement effect, you still suffer the unfavorable modifier in (1).

## Rage / Taunted

You enter **Rage** or **Taunted** when you become uncontrollably furious.

1. You must prioritize attacking or chasing the source of rage. Aside from that, you cannot consider other matters until either you or the source of rage faints or dies.
2. Your skill checks and attribute checks suffer **-4 (unfavorable)**.
3. To regain calm, at the start of each of your turns you may: use a **Difficulty 20 Consciousness** check to regain calm, or perform **1 Full Meditation**. **Half Meditation** can only halve your unfavorable modifier.
4. One **Difficulty 20 Psychological Guidance** check, or damage suffered by a person or object you value, can cause you to immediately regain calm.

## Constitution (CON) Advantage / Disadvantage

Differences in physique can grant an independent special advantage that does not overlap with normal Advantage or Disadvantage.

For each size category difference:

1. For each size category the enemy is **larger** than you, your skill checks and attribute checks against them gain **+1 (favorable)**.
2. For each size category the enemy is **smaller** than you, your damage against them increases by **1d3**, and your skill checks and attribute checks suffer **-1 (unfavorable)**.

**Special:** An extremely large creature is directly treated as spanning **2** size categories.

Typical physique size categories:

| Category | Examples |
|---:|---|
| 1 | Tiny creatures (insects, ants) |
| 2 | Small creatures (rats, birds, a hand) |
| 3 | Small-medium creatures (cats, dogs) |
| 4 | Medium creatures (humans, murlocs, a young lion or tiger) |
| 5 | Medium-large creatures (adult lions, tigers, bears, cattle) |
| 6 | Large creatures (giant descendants, large Beyonder creatures, Feysac people, Beyonders of the Warrior Pathway) |
| 7 | Extremely large creatures (as large as a ship; 4-meter or 6-meter giants; creatures that can destroy a ship by themselves) |

## Bloodbath

You are in **Bloodbath** when you have suffered a grievous wound.

- When your Vitality is below half of your maximum Vitality (rounded up), you are treated as being in the Bloodbath state.
- Entering Bloodbath also gives you the **Bleeding** effect.

Bloodbath is divided into two cases:

### Ordinary People

- At the start of each round, make a **Difficulty 15 Constitution (CON)** check or you faint on the spot and are treated as **Helpless**.
- Before receiving medical treatment, at the start of each round you lose **1d2 Vitality**.

### Beyonders

- You must have gained a Constitution (CON) increase from at least one **Sequence** potion to gain this benefit.
- You do not faint.
- Although you still bleed, you do not lose Vitality.
- You are still treated as being in the Bloodbath state.

Example: If an ability has a special effect against creatures in the Bloodbath state, you still suffer the corresponding effect.

## Bleeding

You are **Bleeding** when you continuously lose Vitality due to injury (only very severe wounds are calculated).

- When you enter Bloodbath, you also gain the Bleeding effect.
- Ordinary abrasions may still require bandaging, but they do not use this calculation.

1. At the start of each round, you lose **1d2 Vitality**. Even if you leave the Bloodbath state, Bleeding does not end until you receive medical first aid or treatment.
2. If the damage is not external (e.g., a Witch Pathway plague effect), you still bleed while in Bloodbath. This represents internal bleeding and organ damage. This bleeding must be stopped by Beyonder-sense medical aid or by reaching a hospital for treatment in time.

## Poisoned

You are **Poisoned** when toxins are actively impairing your body.

- At the start of each round, take **1 Vitality** toxin damage unless the source lists a different poison value.
- Your skill checks and attribute checks suffer **-2 (unfavorable)** while Poisoned.
- Poisoned ends when appropriate treatment resolves the toxin. First Aid only ends Poisoned when the poison came from an external wound.
- Poisoned cannot stack with itself; use the highest per-round poison damage and the longest duration.

## Dying / Death

You are treated as **Dying** or **Dead** when your Vitality reaches 0 or drops below 0.

### Dying

Vitality reduced to 0 or below 0 is treated as **Dying**.

#### Ordinary People

- Each round, you can perform at most **3 Free Actions** and **1 Swift Action**.
- A **Difficulty 15 Willpower (WIL)** check allows you to barely convert these actions into **1 Attack/Casting/Move Action**, but your **Movement** is halved.
- At the start of each round, you must make a **Difficulty 15 Constitution (CON)** check; otherwise you die.

#### Beyonders

- If any Sequence potion you have taken grants a Constitution (CON) increase, you can act normally while Dying.
- Otherwise, you suffer the same adjudication as ordinary people.

### Death

#### Dying Threshold

- `Dying Threshold = -Constitution (CON)`.

- If your Vitality is below 0 and also less than the Dying Threshold: ordinary people die on the spot; Beyonders are adjudicated as ordinary people in the Dying state.
- If your current negative Vitality exceeds **twice** the Dying Threshold, then even Beyonders die on the spot.
- After a Beyonder dies, a Beyonder Characteristic will precipitate after **5 minutes**; see [[id:alias-beyonder-characteristics|Beyonder Characteristics]] for details.
  - Beyonder creatures are treated the same as Beyonders.
- Within **24 hours** after a corpse dies, the spirit body usually still remains in the body. After 24 hours, the spirit body begins to leave the corpse. A corpse that has been given a requiem usually cannot be raised as an undead creature.

> **GM Note:** More special conditions will be listed separately in the corresponding Beyonder Abilities, and the GM may also add additional special conditions.
