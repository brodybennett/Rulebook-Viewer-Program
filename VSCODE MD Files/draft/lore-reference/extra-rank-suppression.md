# Extra: Rank Suppression

## Overview

> **Lore:** In Lord of the Mysteries, as a Beyonder advances in Sequence, their life-form may transform and gain divinity. Higher-ranked beings typically exert overwhelming pressure on lower-ranked beings.

This section defines Status/Rank tiers and the rules for Rank Suppression (the mechanical advantages a higher Status/Rank gains over a lower one in specific matchups).

> **GM Note:** Terminology such as "demigod/saint" is not consistently standardized across sources; this document uses the most common and easily understood usage.

## Status/Rank Tiers

### Ordinary Person (not a Beyonder)

- **Status/Rank:** None.

### Low-Sequence Beyonder (Sequence 9-8)

- **Status/Rank:** None.

### Mid-Sequence Beyonder (Sequence 7-5)

- **Status/Rank:** None.
- **Note:** At this tier, when facing Beyonder items of a lower Sequence level than their own, they have better tolerance for enduring negative effects than other people.

### Demigod/Saint (Sequence 4-3)

- **Status/Rank:** Demigod Status/Rank.
- **Traits:** Possesses divinity.
- **Lifespan:** Significantly increased (average 300+ years), roughly comparable to [[Moon Pathway: Sequence 7]]; Moon Pathway Demigods can live even longer.
- **Beyonder items below Demigod tier:** For the Demigod themself only, the negative effects of those items are halved.
- **Honorific Name:** Only at Sequence 3 does a Beyonder begin to be able to write their own Honorific Name and receive responses within the scope of a city. [[Honorific Name]]

### Angel (Sequence 2-1)

- **Status/Rank:** Angel.
- **Mythical Form:** Able to open Mythical Form without cost; possesses complete divinity. [[Chapter 11: Manifesting Mythical Creature Form]]
- **Beyonder items lower by one Status/Rank:** The effects they suffer are equal to those when a Demigod faces a non-Demigod Beyonder item.
- **Prayer range:** Can listen to followers' prayers; can respond to prayers globally (except specially isolated locations, e.g., the [[Forsaken Land of the Gods]] unless currently inside it or bypassing the restriction by other means).

### Angel King

- **Definition:** Various methods surpassing Sequence 1 without reaching Sequence 0 (see also [[Uniqueness and Sefirah Reference]]).
- **Examples:** Accommodating a Uniqueness, multiple portions of Sequence 1 characteristics, or mastering a Sefirah.
- **Sequence 1 characteristics:** At most three portions.
- **Sefirah interaction:** Only within the range the Sefirah can affect, the Beyonder's Status/Rank is temporarily +1, and they are treated as an Angel King.

### Sequence 0

- **Definition:** Ascender who has obtained three Sequence 1 characteristics and the corresponding Uniqueness.
- **Traits:** Possesses authority that can truly be called divine; usually can easily create planet-level disasters.
- **Prayer range:** Can respond to prayers globally and within the scope of an entire star system.

### Half an Old One

- **Definition:** At least accommodated the Uniqueness of two Pathways, and at the same time mastered a Sefirah.

### Old One

- **Definition:** Formed by accommodating all corresponding Uniquenesses of all adjacent Pathways, possessing at least one Sequence 1 characteristic for each adjacent Pathway, and mastering a Sefirah.
- **Traits:** Usually able to easily create galaxy-level or higher disasters.
- **Prayer range:** The entire universe.

### Pillar

- **Definition:** Ruler or supporter of the entire universe.
- **Notes:** The number of Pillars is usually limited. Even if a Pillar loses Pillar power, they are usually still the strongest existence among Old Ones.

## When Rank Suppression Applies

Starting from Sequence 4, Beyonders begin to gain Status/Rank.

- Each difference of one Status/Rank represents an "insurmountable gulf" in combat (including those who have no Status/Rank).
- Rank Suppression does not apply to all Sequence gaps.

**Rank Suppression matchups (where these rules apply):**
- Sequence 9-5 (including ordinary people) vs Sequence 4.
- Sequence 4 vs Sequence 2.
- Sequence 2 vs an Angel King.
- An Angel King vs Sequence 0.

**Non-example:** A Sequence 6 does not exert Rank Suppression on a Sequence 8; their gap is already large enough, and both are in the "no Status/Rank" category for suppression purposes.

**Status/Rank grouping note:** Sequence 9-5 (including ordinary people) are treated as the same Status/Rank for suppression purposes; they almost have no divinity and cannot produce Rank Suppression.

## Effects of Higher Status/Rank

In a Rank Suppression matchup, when a higher-Status/Rank Beyonder faces a lower one, the higher side typically gains the following benefits.

- **Defense:** All three Defense Ratings gain +10 base value: [[Physical Defense]], Constitution (CON) Defense, and Willpower (WIL) Defense. See also [[Other Defenses]].
- **Attacks vs lower Sequences:** Attack-related skill checks +3, and damage +1d6. See [[Scaling and High-Sequence Additions]].
- **Action Protection:** Gain two layers of Action Protection. See [[Action Protection]].
- **Restricting-type abilities (opposed checks):** Against restricting-type abilities (examples given: "Tight Shut," Moon's Abyss Shackles, Pain Torment), you gain a +5 bonus on the relevant opposed checks.
- **Anti-divination:** Against targets lower than you by one Status/Rank, you inherently have an anti-divination effect.
- **Sanity / Rationality:** If the Sanity / Rationality check you suffer comes from a Status/Rank lower than yours, apply a modifier to the 1d20 roll equal to -4 per Status/Rank difference (examples: lower by 1 Status/Rank = -4; lower by 2 Status/Ranks = -8). See [[Sanity / Rationality]].
- **Death Pathway / undead special rule:** See [[Death Pathway: Undead Command]].

> **GM Note:** In [[High-Sequence Vitality Calculation]] and [[Vitality]] rules, the Vitality (HP) gained from each Status/Rank increase is doubled.

### Action Protection

- **Benefit:** You gain two layers of Action Protection.
- **Trigger:** If an ability whose Status/Rank is lower than yours attempts to reduce your Free Action, Swift Action, spellcasting action, attack action, or movement action, you may use divinity to resist the loss of actions.
- **Limits:** This protection has no usage limit; the stated upper limit is that it can negate reductions to up to two actions.
- **Selection:** Which specific action an Action Protection layer protects is decided by the higher-Status/Rank being themself.
- **What it does not protect against:** Action Protection does not include binding-type abilities (example given: Moon's Abyss Shackles). These do not cause you to lose actions; they make you unable to perform actions. Your actions are not lost - only prevented - so Action Protection cannot negate them. You must make the corresponding escape check to avoid the binding.
- **Free/Swift Action special handling:** If you suffer an effect such as "each round you can only use one Free Action," you may use one Action Protection to negate this effect once. A Free Action's Action Protection is equivalent to three Free Action uses. Swift Action is the same and likewise provides three uses. If a negative status reduces one Free/Swift action, three reductions are required to consume one protection of your Free/Swift actions. If it specifically states "can only use one Free Action," you can use two Free Action protections to resist this effect a total of two times. Only when your Free Action protections are used up, and a third "one Free Action" limitation is stacked onto you, will your Free Action count truly be affected (you begin to be able to use only one Free Action).

[[UNCLEAR: Action Protection is described as having "no usage limit" but also as being "consumed" by stacked reductions; when or how (if ever) protections refresh is not specified.]]

### Death Pathway: Undead Command

This benefit is limited to the Death Pathway and undead creatures.

If you are an undead creature and are facing undead creatures that are lower than you by one Status/Rank, then so long as they are in front of you, and there are no other undead present whose Status/Rank is higher than yours or equal to yours, if you issue commands to undead creatures lower than you by one Status/Rank or more, they are unable to disobey and must obey completely, even if ordered to commit suicide.

While in this state, if that undead creature dares to do anything to you, all of its checks -4.

This also applies if the undead creature is a Death Pathway Beyonder (provided they have advanced to Sequence 7 and are regarded as an undead creature).

Conversely, if you face a Death Pathway that is higher than you by one Status/Rank, this situation will also occur.

Additional related case: If the other party is not higher than you by one Status/Rank, but only by +1 Sequence level, then they do not have absolute command authority over you, but you still suffer all checks -4, and your body unconsciously trembles (this can be concealed).

> **GM Note:** Even without being lower by one Status/Rank, usually, with only a gap of two Sequence levels, the words of the higher-ranked still have a powerful binding effect on the lower-ranked.

## Edge Cases and Using Lower-Rank Tools

### Lower-Status/Rank using higher-Status/Rank items or abilities

Even if an existence is lower Status/Rank, if they hold a Beyonder item whose Status/Rank is equal to yours or higher (e.g., a Demigod-tier or Angel-tier item), then limited to the use of that item, it has normal bonuses against you or may even gain bonuses that suppress you in reverse.

Demigod skills obtained through recording and other means also enjoy Rank Suppression effects. When you use a Demigod skill to attack, you can enjoy all of the Rank Suppression attack benefits. When facing theft, so long as the target is your Demigod ability, you also enjoy the benefits brought by the Defense bonuses above.

### Higher-Status/Rank using lower-Status/Rank items or benefits in high-rank combat

If a Demigod uses only a Sequence 5-tier Beyonder item to fight in a Demigod-tier battle, all abilities related to that Sequence 5 item suffer Rank Suppression, and other Demigods facing that item gain Rank Suppression benefits against it.

Practical note stated by the source text: Starting from Demigod, Sequence 5-tier Beyonder items are already quite limited. At present, only a Black Emperor Pathway Sequence 4 Demigod can compensate for this gap by increasing the item's Sequence level, allowing the Sequence 5 item to function normally.

If, during the Demigod stage, a Sequence 5 ability grants you additional actions, then when you perform those extra actions obtained through that mid/low-Sequence item, those extra actions suffer Rank Suppression effects (regardless of whether you yourself are a Demigod).

If a Sequence 5 item provides bonuses to yourself (example given: Holy Covenant increasing STR by 6 and DEX by 6), then checks are calculated separately. One calculation is for your own damage, which does not suffer Rank Suppression. One calculation separately computes the damage provided by the item. The additional STR damage dice gained from those +6 STR must subtract your original STR damage dice, then make a separate check; this separate check suffers Rank Suppression.

### Low-Sequence assistance that does not directly affect the opponent

Only when the benefits brought by a mid/low-Sequence Beyonder item (or assistance) do not involve another Demigod at all will they not suffer the relevant Rank Suppression handling.

**Example:** A Sequence 6 Spectator hypnotizes you to keep you awake. If this hypnosis is used to resist another Demigod's entering dreams, that resistance effect is equivalent to Sequence 6: when facing a Demigod, the effect will be halved or almost none, or an additional WIL opposed check is made, with the opposing Demigod gaining the Rank Suppression bonus to determine whether the hypnosis takes effect. If the Sequence 6 Spectator truly causes no influence on the other Demigod's checks and only improves the hypnotized Demigod's state slightly (e.g., a +1 or +2 bonus), does not increase damage, and is not used as a shield to resist damage, then there is no need to calculate additional checks or bonuses for Rank Suppression.

> **GM Note:** Upon reaching Demigod, trying to use Sequence 5 or lower power to intervene in a Demigod battle is generally not advisable: it often costs significant effort with little result and is better used outside Demigod-tier combat.

## Scaling and High-Sequence Additions

If you are higher than the target by multiple Status/Ranks (example given: a Demigod facing an Angel King), all advantages gained by the higher side are doubled.

Special note on "advantage effects in special states": The advantages of Status/Rank also enjoy advantage effects in special states; that is, the +3 attack-check bonus against lower Sequences is treated as actual +5 in those cases.

### Sequence 1 Special Skill: Convergence Law Control

Upon reaching the Sequence 1 tier, against existences lower than yourself in Status/Rank, you also gain an additional skill: control the Beyonder Characteristic Convergence Law. [[Beyonder Characteristic Convergence Law]]

**Special Skill (Convergence Law Control):**
- **Use:** Use a spellcasting action to control the Beyonder Characteristic Convergence Law.
- **Effect:** You attract all existences of the same Sequence as you, among the targets you designate within the range of an entire city, to you.
- **Timing:** If the distance spans an entire city, it takes one full round.
- **Adjacent-Pathway limitation:** If you yourself are a Sequence 1 Angel of a Pathway, using this ability on other Angels of adjacent Pathways can only serve to draw their attention.

For the concept of adjacent Pathways, see [[Chapter 16: Explanation of Switching Sequences]].

### Sequence 0 and Beyond

- **Dual-Pathway Sequence 0 advantage:** Upon reaching Sequence 0, for each additional adjacent Pathway Uniqueness you accommodate, or adjacent Pathway Sequence 1 characteristic you accommodate (becoming a dual-Pathway Sequence 0), your Status/Rank can be +1 when facing other Sequence 0s.
- **Old One vs Sequence 0:** Old One Status/Rank and Sequence 0 Status/Rank have an essential gap. Only when an Old One Status/Rank faces Sequence 0, the overall advantages gained are tripled (not doubled).
- **Pillar vs Old One:** A Pillar Status/Rank facing an Old One gains advantages doubled.

## Draft Material: Becoming a Deity

> **GM Note:** The source text marks the following material as "under revision and not yet complete; for reference only."

**Stated framework:** From Sequence 4 onward you can obtain divinity and are regarded as an incomplete Mythical Creature. From Sequence 2 onward you are regarded as a complete Mythical Creature. Sequence 0 is considered a true deity. See also [[Chapter 11: Manifesting Mythical Creature Form]].

**Mental-state premise (as written):** As Sequence rises, sanity gradually enters a crisis; the "Primordial" within may awaken. Taking Sequence 2 as a node, higher Sequences do not necessarily mean stronger in every respect; mental state may worsen and require maintaining sanity balance.

**Purpose (as written):** Before truly becoming a deity, gather followers and obtain "anchors" to stabilize sanity (even "false anchors"). Without these, advancing to Sequence 2 may cause you to lose control on the spot. See also [[Rituals and Followers]] and [[Gods and Faith]].

### Drafting an Honorific Name

This procedure assumes you intend to advance to Sequence 2 and want to reduce the risk of losing control.

At Sequence 3, in addition to the ritual, you also need to spread faith. Followers may chant your Honorific Name when necessary. You can receive prayers and use Beyonder powers remotely at the location of the prayer.

**Honorific Name drafting process (as written):**
1. Summarize your character sheet's life experiences; find at least one unique trait unlikely for anyone else to match.
2. Use that trait as the core; write the Honorific Name by stacking "key phrases" until it filters to only you.
3. In practice, a normal Sequence 3-1 Honorific Name is usually 4 parts or 5 parts, and must include one's true name or a false identity name, to accurately filter among all Beyonder existences.

**Three-part name restriction (as written):** Three-part Honorific Names usually fit cases where either (1) the owner has obtained Uniqueness or a Sefirah/Sefirot, or (2) the owner is subordinate to or attendant of someone who has Uniqueness or a Sefirah/Sefirot (borrowing that level).

Examples are discussed in [[Names and Honorific Titles of Mystical Deities and Angels]].

> **Lore (example provided by the source text; "do not plagiarize"):**
> "The all-knowing book yet to be filled,
> The elusive two-faced demon,
> The girl who sees into hearts, the saint who stirs men's hearts.
> Backlund's most brilliant red-and-blue gemstone.
> Cute and playful, Luo Xi - Meme."

[[UNCLEAR: The Honorific Name example analysis is truncated mid-sentence in the provided text (ends at "humanity and ...").]]

## Uniqueness and Sefirah Reference

Uniqueness and Sefirah/Sefirot are key concepts for advancement beyond Sequence 1.

- **Uniqueness:** Described as the "core" of a Pathway and key to mastering an entire Pathway of Sequences. Only by possessing the Uniqueness does one have "absolute sovereignty" over that Pathway, including manipulating knowledge contained in potion advancements and (to an extent) regulating abilities displayed by that Pathway.
- **Sefirah:** Described as the core by which adjacent Pathways ascend from Sequence 0 to become an Old One. Sefirah influence can temporarily increase Status/Rank by +1 within its effective range (treated as Angel King).

**Additional restrictions (as written):** For Beyonders below the level of an Old One, it is impossible to summon or copy Uniqueness via historical projection (indirect summoning may be possible via summoning an empowered holder). Anything involving Uniqueness cannot be affected by "Restart" or "Reverse Time" abilities; anything related to Uniqueness is invalid under those effects. Example given: if someone who has accommodated Uniqueness participates in a battle, then from the time they arrived, fate can no longer be "Restarted".

> **Lore (analogy included in the source text):** A sphere analogy is used: shell = Sefirot, flesh = Beyonder Characteristics, core = Uniqueness. This describes a "split" and the process an Old One reverses by re-accommodating key parts. (See also [[id:alias-beyonder-characteristics|Beyonder Characteristics]].)

### Accommodating Uniqueness

- **Requirement:** You must become Sequence 1 to accommodate Uniqueness.
- **Method (as written):** Hold a simplified ritual for advancing to Sequence 0, then ingest the Uniqueness "as if it were a potion". It is simplified because accommodation ritual requirements are lower than a full Sequence 0 advancement ritual. It is not mandatory to accommodate Uniqueness before advancing to Sequence 0; you can advance directly and accommodate during advancement. Pre-accommodation is often used when one cannot meet advancement conditions for a long time.
- **Adjacent-Pathway restriction (as written):** Before becoming Sequence 0, you cannot accommodate the Uniqueness of an adjacent Pathway; otherwise you will become half-mad.

[[UNCLEAR: The text introduces "Uniqueness List" entries and "known holders", but no list or entries are included in this section.]]

### Benefits of Accommodating Any Uniqueness (as written)

- **Accommodation effect:** Your Status/Rank rises to an Angel King. You can use Sequence 0 Beyonder abilities at half effect, rounding up.
- **Pathway adjustment:** You begin to be able to adjust parts of this Pathway. Adjusting takes 1 [[Full-Round Action]]. Adjustable content includes:
1. Any ability effect can be reproduced at full effect through recording, simulation, and similar means; conversely, you can halve an effect.
2. Add or remove the knowledge gained when advancing in this Pathway.
3. Make an "all-channel broadcast" to Beyonders of this Pathway, delivering your voice to all Beyonders of the Pathway in a manner similar to responding to prayers; you can also decide that some Beyonders cannot hear it. Beyonders of the same Sequence level as you in the same Pathway or adjacent Pathways can hear it with a Spiritual Intuition check even if you did not broadcast to them.
4. Other GM-approved content. Generally does not include increasing damage, etc. You are adjusting effects or adding logically consistent effects; you cannot increase original effects to an abnormal degree.

> **GM Note:** The source text states these benefits "may contain errors" and invites revision based on original-work text.
