# UNCLEAR Review Queue (Batch 2 of 50)

[1] draft/core-rules/ritual-magic.md:430 | The provided example (Sequence 4-tier -> 75 Spirituality) does not clearly follow from the listed formula without additional assumptions about "Sequence level equivalent" and/or "Rank equivalent."
[2] draft/core-rules/skills-professions.md:57 | The text both states Dodge cannot be selected using Intuition (INT) and later discusses selecting it with Intuition (including stacking).
[3] draft/front-matter/preface.md:48 | Some editions reference Chapter 14 under a different title ("The Hidden Sage's Diary"); confirm this crosslink points to the intended module guide.
[4] draft/lore-reference/extra-rank-suppression.md:115 | Action Protection is described as having "no usage limit" but also as being "consumed" by stacked reductions; when or how (if ever) protections refresh is not specified.
[5] draft/lore-reference/extra-rank-suppression.md:215 | The Honorific Name example analysis is truncated mid-sentence in the provided text (ends at "humanity and ...").
[6] draft/lore-reference/extra-rank-suppression.md:234 | The text introduces "Uniqueness List" entries and "known holders", but no list or entries are included in this section.
[7] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-01.md:9 | RAW does not specify which Pathway this Sequence belongs to, so the standard “<Pathway> Pathway” heading cannot be applied.
[8] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-03.md:35 | The RAW does not specify whose Will Defense is used (one target vs each listener vs another rule).
[9] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-03.md:36 | The RAW does not state how long this “per round” loss persists or what ends it.
[10] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-03.md:37 | The RAW lists outcomes but provides no mechanical triggers, tests, or quantified effects for these outcomes.
[11] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-03.md:39 | The RAW does not define what “reverse the influence” entails mechanically.
[12] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-03.md:43 | The RAW does not define how a connection is established, any costs/tests/limits, or the mechanical meaning of “die violently.”
[13] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-03.md:48 | The RAW does not define what “Inspiration identification” is (test type, DC/target, or procedure).
[14] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-03.md:49 | The RAW does not define what influence is being reversed here, or the action/test required.
[15] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-04.md:15 | The overview states nearby thinking becomes “less error-prone,” but the ability “Stupid Aura” states nearby thinking is reduced and mistakes become easier.
[16] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-04.md:47 | “not in the same position as you—enemies with different grids” is not defined in RAW and may reference a separate faction/alignment or positioning rule.
[17] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-05.md:32 | “extra intellectual resistance through intoxication and sinking” is referenced as essential, but no concrete mechanical procedure is given here.
[18] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-05.md:57 | “danger disappears, appears or reaches a safe zone” is internally unclear as a duration condition.
[19] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-05.md:145 | The “Explosion of Desire” loss formula and how the “remaining value” converts into 1d6 damage dice is not mechanically unambiguous as written.
[20] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-05.md:156 | “designated by you as Player” could refer to the caster choosing the action, but controller/authority is not explicitly defined.
[21] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-05.md:248 | “extraordinary ability greater than one of you” is not precisely defined (comparison basis and timing unclear).
[22] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-06.md:42 | “reduce the operation level by 1” is not defined in this text, and the list of examples (“torture, awe, marionette”) is unclear about what is being reduced.
[23] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-06.md:74 | The calculation note references “targets selected by the second fireball” twice, including for the first fireball; the intended targeting/appraisal shortcut is unclear.
[24] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-06.md:160 | The final word “hair” appears to be a stray fragment; the intended sentence ending is unclear.
[25] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-06.md:190 | It is unclear how “without taking damage” interacts with “still lose the ability to cast it and consume life points,” and whether this changes the health-to-damage conversion.
[26] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-06.md:198 | “corrupted words for hurting people” and “cannot be suppressed” are not defined here; the scope and procedure of this Sequence 7 strengthening rule are unclear.
[27] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-07.md:24 | The exact procedure and what "realize anti-divination" means in play is not defined; the text ties mystic identification difficulty to anti-divination difficulty but does not specify the roll/check type.
[28] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-07.md:25 | "Excluding the spirit body arranged in advance by the psychic" is grammatically unclear; it likely names an exception, but the exact scope of that exception is not explicit.
[29] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-07.md:33 | The text's "pray that the gods will default to the 'dark side of the universe'" is not clearly defined as a rule (target, effect, or limitation).
[30] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-07.md:43 | This appears to waive sacrifices for the next prayer while also requiring sacrifices "in advance"; the timing and "quantity requirements" reference is not defined here.
[31] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-07.md:57 | The conditions for when this instead becomes "what you should do next" are not mechanically defined.
[32] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-07.md:82 | "Immunotoxin" is not defined; it likely indicates immunity to toxins/poison, but the exact rule term is unclear.
[33] draft/sequences/abyss/seq-08.md:83 | This clause does not specify whether it restricts only this spell’s reuse, or interacts with another “swear words” ability/usage pool.
[34] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-01.md:34 | The clause about "obscuration and sealing of the old level" and "pried" is unclear in meaning and mechanical impact.
[35] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-01.md:41 | The RAW does not specify whether the -8 applies to the caster, the target, or the overall contest.
[36] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-01.md:71 | "Similar to that of a door" is a comparator without specifying which Door mechanic is meant.
[37] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-01.md:75 | The permanence rule here depends on an unspecified "door ability" reference.
[38] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-01.md:81 | The roles ("stolen person" vs "judged person") and the exact restoration restrictions are unclear.
[39] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-02.md:55 | The RAW indicates “two different recording options” for angel-level difficulty, but does not state what determines which option applies.
[40] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-02.md:61 | “actual calculation does not need to be distinguished” is not explicit about what calculation/resistance distinction is waived.
[41] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-03.md:16 | The ritual mixes “most places” with “all places” as requirements, and the exact completion threshold is unclear.
[42] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-04.md:17 | The clause about the target’s “personality” being “not lower than a demigod” is unclear in meaning/criteria.
[43] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-04.md:39 | “Smash a crystal ball” and the exact procedure/effects of “counter-scry” are not defined here.
[44] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-04.md:45 | “Up to the planet” is ambiguous as a range/limit (e.g., within a planet vs. planetary scale).
[45] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-04.md:59 | The phrase “checked again against the door” implies a separate confrontation/check that is not fully specified here.
[46] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-04.md:63 | “Fails in the confrontation” is unclear (which roll/check and against what target number).
[47] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-04.md:79 | “Health is independent” likely refers to each connecting door/space having separate durability, but the exact object(s) with health is not specified.
[48] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-05.md:46 | “higher than 1 character” and “enemy also has travelers” are not defined clearly enough to determine the exact exclusion condition.
[49] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-05.md:54 | RAW uses both “spirituality” and “spirit” as costs without clarifying whether they are the same resource.
[50] draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-06.md:44 | “character” is not defined (rank/level/attribute)
