23. draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-02.md:48 | What specifically qualifies as “breaking through the limit/restrictions,” and exactly when this +1 applies within the balancing calculation.

27. draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-04.md:55 | The phrase “theoretical maximum damage dice exceeds 40 points” mixes dice and points, so the exact threshold calculation is not fully defined.
28. draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-04.md:67 | “One bit lower” is not defined (likely Sequence or rank), so the exact comparison basis is unclear.
29. draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-05.md:33 | The text says all crimes must be punished for safe promotion, yet also says having 3 unpaid sins is generally safe.
30. draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-05.md:44 | “upgrade to knowledge” is undefined and may reference another subsystem.

39. draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-07.md:44 | The ability is described as targeting the “spirit body,” but its mechanics reference “mental puncture” and deal “mental damage,” and the relationship between these terms is not defined here.
40. draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-07.md:65 | It is not stated whether step (2) requires step (1) to be active, or how the “maintenance period” timing interacts with using step (2).
