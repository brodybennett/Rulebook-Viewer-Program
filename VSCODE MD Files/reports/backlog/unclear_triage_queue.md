## Proposed Next Batch (40)

- `draft/advanced-systems/beyonder-creatures/mist-treant.md:36` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The defense formula references "agility," but the basic data lists "Dexterity".
- `draft/advanced-systems/mythical-creature-form.md:41` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The condition that determines which of the two outcomes applies is not stated.
- `draft/advanced-systems/mythical-creature-form.md:89` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | No mechanical procedure is provided for "Random Teleportation."
- `draft/advanced-systems/mythical-creature-form.md:235` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The outcome when the total equals current Sanity is not stated.
- `draft/advanced-systems/mythical-creature-form.md:244` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | "sanity damage is directly taken to full" could mean maximum possible loss for that event or reducing Sanity to 0; the intended resolution is not stated.
- `draft/advanced-systems/mythical-creature-form.md:416` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | Mechanical resolution for resisting/gliding is not specified; "ordinary silver knight" is undefined here.
- `draft/core-rules/attributes.md:17` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | Point-buy starting values and the point cost per increase are not stated.
- `draft/core-rules/attributes.md:105` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The rule does not state how to convert the opposed 1d20 result into a specific damage amount; it only says "corresponding" damage.
- `draft/core-rules/becoming-a-beyonder/advancement.md:66` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | "invert the effect of (5)" does not specify the exact calculation.
- `draft/core-rules/becoming-a-beyonder/spirituality-and-abilities.md:27` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | Spirituality recovery for rests under 30 minutes (and more than 5 minutes short of 1 hour) is not specified.
- `draft/core-rules/becoming-a-beyonder/spirituality-and-abilities.md:33` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | "Maximum rest time" and rounding for this formula are not defined here.
- `draft/core-rules/becoming-a-beyonder/spirituality-and-abilities.md:70` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | It is not specified which part of (3) is gated by the "Sequence level that provides a CON increase" condition.
- `draft/core-rules/beyonder-items.md:15` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | This procedure assumes the item's Sequence rank is already known (e.g., from the Beyonder Characteristic used), but does not state how to determine it when generating "purely randomly."
- `draft/core-rules/combat/special-actions.md:141` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The text states both sides gain "advantage/disadvantage" while grappling, but does not specify which rolls get which modifier.
- `draft/core-rules/combat/weapon-examples.md:86` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The "1 additional roll" does not specify the target(s) or whether it applies per creature in the area.
- `draft/core-rules/ritual-magic.md:430` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The provided example (Sequence 4-tier -> 75 Spirituality) does not clearly follow from the listed formula without additional assumptions about "Sequence level equivalent" and/or "Rank equivalent."
- `draft/lore-reference/extra-rank-suppression.md:115` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | Action Protection is described as having "no usage limit" but also as being "consumed" by stacked reductions; when or how (if ever) protections refresh is not specified.
- `draft/sequences/abyss/seq-01.md:9` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | RAW does not specify which Pathway this Sequence belongs to, so the standard “<Pathway> Pathway” heading cannot be applied.
- `draft/sequences/abyss/seq-03.md:35` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The RAW does not specify whose Will Defense is used (one target vs each listener vs another rule).
- `draft/sequences/abyss/seq-05.md:145` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The “Explosion of Desire” loss formula and how the “remaining value” converts into 1d6 damage dice is not mechanically unambiguous as written.
- `draft/sequences/abyss/seq-06.md:74` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The calculation note references “targets selected by the second fireball” twice, including for the first fireball; the intended targeting/appraisal shortcut is unclear.
- `draft/sequences/abyss/seq-07.md:24` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The exact procedure and what "realize anti-divination" means in play is not defined; the text ties mystic identification difficulty to anti-divination difficulty but does not specify the roll/check type.
- `draft/sequences/abyss/seq-08.md:83` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | This clause does not specify whether it restricts only this spell’s reuse, or interacts with another “swear words” ability/usage pool.
- `draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-01.md:41` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The RAW does not specify whether the -8 applies to the caster, the target, or the overall contest.
- `draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-02.md:61` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | “actual calculation does not need to be distinguished” is not explicit about what calculation/resistance distinction is waived.
- `draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-04.md:39` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | “Smash a crystal ball” and the exact procedure/effects of “counter-scry” are not defined here.
- `draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-04.md:79` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | “Health is independent” likely refers to each connecting door/space having separate durability, but the exact object(s) with health is not specified.
- `draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-08.md:118` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The phrase “the gain is disadvantageous” is not clearly defined in context of Blind.
- `draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-08.md:148` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | Electric Shock allows “another check” to paralyze a wet target but does not specify what check is used or what it is checked against.
- `draft/sequences/apprentice/seq-09.md:26` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | “growth skill can be added twice as much as the inspiration of the potion” is unclear on the exact calculation and what is being increased.
- `draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-00.md:30` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | “Use your extraordinary ability to target the area at will” does not specify which abilities qualify or what normal targeting limits still apply.
- `draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-02.md:48` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | What specifically qualifies as “breaking through the limit/restrictions,” and exactly when this +1 applies within the balancing calculation.
- `draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-03.md:19` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | "greater than the Sequence 3 level" is unclear in scope/criteria (e.g., how to measure or apply it).
- `draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-04.md:55` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The phrase “theoretical maximum damage dice exceeds 40 points” mixes dice and points, so the exact threshold calculation is not fully defined.
- `draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-05.md:96` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | “Different crimes separate sentence” is unclear (how to segment, and whether multiple crimes can be applied in one use).
- `draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-06.md:118` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | The edge-case “countermeasure equivalent to confinement” procedure does not specify how it is resolved (timing/check/etc.).
- `draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-07.md:65` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | It is not stated whether step (2) requires step (1) to be active, or how the “maintenance period” timing interacts with using step (2).
- `draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-07.md:92` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | “Other creatures gain advantages/disadvantages against them” does not specify which applies (advantage vs disadvantage), to what rolls, or under what conditions.
- `draft/sequences/arbiter/seq-09.md:72` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | Two different scaling rules are given (“per Sequence” and “per character”); it is unclear whether both apply, and what “character” means here.
- `draft/sequences/black-emperor/seq-04.md:38` | Missing Procedure/Resolution | It is not specified whether the “once per round” free action still requires the listed cost and casting action, or replaces them.
