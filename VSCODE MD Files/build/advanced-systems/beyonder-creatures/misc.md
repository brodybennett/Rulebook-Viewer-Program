## Creatures and notes (described)

### Trickery monster

Also known as a shapeshifter.

- **Traits:** does not have the wisdom to communicate; good at setting traps and dealing with targets
- **Corresponds to:** a **Sequence 4** “crafty mage” who is “half of the Fool’s Pathway,” and has incomplete abilities
- [[UNCLEAR: “crafty mage,” “half of the Fool’s Pathway,” and “incomplete abilities” are not defined here.]]

### Spirit Realm Predator

- **Habitat:** depths of the [[LINK LATER: Spirit Realm | type=location | hint=otherworld/realm]]
- **Traits:** rare in number; full of wisdom; extremely aggressive
- **Capabilities (RAW phrasing preserved where needed):**
  - Can transform captured or killed creatures into their own souls.
  - Corresponds to “half of the Fool’s Pathway,” a **Sequence 4** “crafty mage,” with incomplete ability to make one’s “soul split,” that is, marionette, into one’s own appearance, or the appearance of other Spirit Realm creatures.
  - Their sub-souls can change into the appearance of their real soul bodies, have similar performance and special features, and can also pretend to be other Spirit Realm creatures.
  - Can effectively affect the thinking ability of prey, causing them to appear paralyzed.
  - The spirituality of the real soul body itself is very strong, and it can often gain a lot of advantages in related confrontations.
- **Encounter note:** difficult to find; only one place has traces of their activities—the city of [[LINK LATER: Calderon | type=location | hint=city in the Spirit Realm]]
- **Potion material:** its real soul body can be used to make potions for “crafty mages”
- [[UNCLEAR: Several terms and fragments are unclear (e.g., “soul split,” “marionette,” “spirituality,” and “similar performance”), and RAW sentence structure is partially broken.]]

### Psychic dragon

Existing psychic dragons of the Fifth Epoch usually belong to the presence of demigods or higher in the Audience Pathway.

- [[UNCLEAR: “belong to the presence of demigods or higher” is unclear as a classification statement.]]
