# Hornacis Gray Goat

## Description

A monstrous, gray, tentacle-covered, six-legged monstrosity. There is no face. A large number of tentacles stretch out from its thick lower limbs and wave.

These tentacles are full of power and have a strong reproductive ability, which can easily bind, restrain, and tear those poor creatures caught by the **Hornacis Gray Goat**.

In the middle of the **black** tentacles of the black goat, there is a crystal. According to rumors, this crystal has incredible power.

[[UNCLEAR: RAW describes the tentacles as both gray and black.]]

## Habits

Hornachs gray goats are dominated by lower desires, most commonly appetite and sex. Their genetic factors are capable of impregnating all living things.

The place where the **Hornacis Gray Goat** is infested is often a forest of flesh and blood, and there are many offspring among them who will spy on and torture the poor creatures that enter the forest.

> **Lore:** Their genetic factors are capable of impregnating all living things.

## Environment

### Breeding environment

The **Hornacis Gray Goat** can impregnate any creature under any circumstances. Wherever it goes, its genetic factors will invade various plants and animals, and a large number of weird creations will be produced in the environment.

The process by which gray goats impregnate creatures can often be dangerous and violent. If the matrix is strong enough, or if it can pass a sinister ritual, it may reduce the danger.

### Living environment

Hornacis gray goats like to live near mountains; for example, it is easy to find this kind of gray goat near the [[LINK LATER: Hornacis Mountains | type=location | hint=mountain range associated with these creatures]].

No matter where it is, the surrounding plants will grow rapidly, so that it will grow into patches of dense forest, and the **Hornacis Gray Goat** will hide in the center of the dense forest.

- **Flesh Forest:** The plants near the **Hornacis Gray Goat** will look extremely weird, grow tentacles, or wriggle.
- **Flesh Creation:** Creatures near the **Hornacis Gray Goat** will produce a **Flesh Mutant**.
  - **Mutant Flesh:** Strength +2; gains 1 point of **fast healing**; and likely possesses the extraordinary ability of a **Hornacis Gray Goat**.

> **GM Note:** This is a treasure trove for the Earth **Sequence**, because they often find suitable biological configuration potions and enslave some creatures. [[LINK LATER: Earth Sequence | type=sequence | hint=group or Pathway faction tied to “Earth”]]
