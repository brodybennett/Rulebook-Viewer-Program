# Overview

This chapter presents guidance for running Lord of the Mysteries-style modules and summarizes traits and play guidance across multiple **Pathway**/**Sequence** lines for **Beyonder** characters.

> **Lore:** A **Beyonder** of the Mystery Pryer pathway begged the Hidden Sage for knowledge of each pathway. The Hidden Sage poured knowledge directly into his mind until it “swelled and swelled.” After learning it, the Beyonder’s head exploded, and his **Beyonder Characteristic** condensed together with the diary book beside him into a **Beyonder Item**. This item records the content below and is named “The Hidden Sage’s Diary Book.”

[[UNCLEAR: The text says it “expand[s] and explain[s] the traits and characteristics of 22 Sequences,” but the surrounding context discusses pathways; the exact intended meaning of “22 Sequences” is unclear.]]

# Module Guidance for Extraordinary Abilities

## Do not “solve” balance by ignoring abilities

- Lord of the Mysteries rules include many abilities that can destroy scenarios; writing modules can be difficult.
- Ignoring or weakening Beyonder abilities can also harm immersion.
- The guidance here rejects “forced restraint” via ignoring/weakening as “putting the cart before the horse.”

## Use countermeasures that exist in-setting

- Extraordinary power has extraordinary countermeasures:
  - Divination and spirit communication have ritual magic for counter-divination or counter–spirit communication.
- Countermeasures usually require:
  - The strong countering the stronger.
  - Concealing only the most crucial fine details.
  - Clues and direction (divination requires both).

## Practical GM approach to divination

- Provide appropriate clues as needed.
- Counter-divine the most crucial matters.
- Allow Players to divine effective information so they can have fun without breaking the scenario.
- Divination need not be limited to “mystery-solving” only.

> **GM Note:** Divination should be treated as a reference; full reliance may lead to “extremely dangerous disaster,” because many situations counter-divine or affect divination.

# Pathway Notes

## Seer

### Divination methods (do not limit to coin flips)

- Seers at low Sequences have broad divination methods (not limited to one method), including:
  - coin divination
  - tarot divination
  - pendulum divination
  - astrolabe divination
  - dream divination
  - astrology divination
- “There is no divination a Seer cannot do—only counter-divination that a Seer cannot divine through.”

**Pendulum divination**
- The pendulum pendant judges risk based on what the Seer speaks aloud or silently recites.
- It rotates counterclockwise or clockwise; rotation speed represents degree of risk.

**Tarot divination**
- Requires the Seer Player to have basic tarot knowledge, or the GM can directly give the result.
- Tarot indicates the direction something will develop toward, allowing more accurate indication of what will happen.

**Dream divination**
- The Seer silently recites or writes down what they want to divine.
- They enter light sleep through meditation.
- They directly see images (as opposed to broader information like tarot).

**Coin divination**
- Simply tells whether something is yes/no, positive/negative.

### Sequence abilities (overview)

- Low Sequences: rely on divination and the melee physical technique abilities of Sequence 8 **Clown**.
- Overall capability at low Sequences is “at least mid-tier.”
- Suitable for beginners; this is the pathway of the Lord of the Mysteries protagonist.

- Mid Sequences:
  - Sequence 7 **Magician** gains the paper figurine substitute:
    - Even if an opponent’s single strike deals **999999** damage, one substitute can directly nullify it,
    - unless it is an area attack or a strike far beyond your **Rank**.  
  - Magician also has illusions; bone softening enables bending back **90 degrees**, coordinating with Clown movement for spectacle.
  - Sequence 6 **Faceless** is practical in intelligence wars: changing faces to “start over.”
  - **Bizarro Sorcerer** is a qualitative change: can hide behind the scenes, turn others into marionettes to act, and use the other party’s abilities.

- Mortal:
  - Seers have more bizarre and powerful strength.
  - Seers lack direct attack methods:
    - first-class at survival,
    - but marionettes are always consumed.
  - It is hard to accumulate enough marionettes for coordinated play for an entire Beyonder team; they are often lost before being stockpiled.

### Campaign impact and GM handling

- Choosing Seer is usually for divination.
- Divination can:
  - help investigation,
  - divine risk,
  - divine what to do now,
  - divine people threatening you,
  - support planning.

**Do not rely entirely on divination**
- Many situations counter-divine or affect divination.
- Treat divination as reference.

**GM control of images**
- The images obtained by Seer abilities are controlled by the GM.
- Provide images that are correct, effective, and sufficiently informative.
- Allow multiple interpretations to limit the Seer’s ability.

**Example (keep images interpretable)**
- Premise: The newspaper in the mailbox at the victim’s door implies that the killer is a postman.
- When the Seer attempts to divine how to find the murderer, the GM can describe:

> A scene appears before your eyes—this is exactly the front of the victim’s house.  
> You see yourself standing in front of the victim’s house, before that front door. Beside it is a mailbox. You see that inside the door is pitch-black, as if you cannot see what is inside. Next, you notice that beside it is the house’s window; you can go around to the side and observe the situation inside the house. Your vision keeps staring at the entire house. Your Spirituality intuition tells you that within this scene there is an important clue to finding the murderer.

- When the Seer attempts to divine the crime scene:
  - The GM can cite “insufficient information.”
  - Describe the murderer as a figure shrouded entirely in black with an indistinguishable face,
  - while describing in detail how they killed other beings.

**Spirituality cost**
- At low Sequences, the **Spirituality** cost of divination is very high; the GM should calculate consumption.
- At Sequence 9, after about **3–4** uses, Spirituality will be exhausted.

**Divination can be dangerous**
- In some cases, divination itself is dangerous; hint this subtly in advance.

## Apprentice

> **GM Note:** More suitable for slice-of-life and travel games, but becomes a key combatant at mid Sequences.

### Positioning

- Before Sequence 6/5, Apprentices are “very weak.”
- They have many tricks and variable effects.
- Sequence 9:
  - can open the door to the **Spirit World**,
  - can pass through walls,
  - has strong escape/survival.
- Before Sequence 6, they lack attack methods.
- Sequence 7 adds divination and counter-divination, but it is “too late.”
- Sequence 9 lockpicking/locking requires the Player to have enough ideas to leverage it.

**Low-Sequence role**
- Team support; win key moments by cleverness.
- Major reason to choose: open doors of ruins, pass mazes, directly reach a location.
- Best in modules with complex terrain and many treasures.
- Strategy: fully utilize mobility—while teammates draw monster fire, enter scenes to loot wealth and clues.
- Early stage GM placement:
  - include things only Apprentice abilities can obtain,
  - set multiple treasure chests for Apprentices to unlock, providing rewards.

### Recording (mid Sequence core and ceiling)

- Sequence 6:
  - outstanding combat potential; “one of the few” mid-Sequence pathways with extremely high ceiling.
  - can record demigod-level abilities:
    - even if effect is halved,
    - even if each recorded ability can only be used once,
    - with sufficient reserves, a Sequence 6 can influence a demigod battle;
    - the halving is removed at Sequence 5.
- Drawback:
  - recording requires witnessing with one’s own eyes.
  - implies backing/organization/connections; also means the floor is very low.
- Common situation:
  - most Apprentices record Sequence 6–5 abilities; combat role mid-to-upper.
  - high-difficulty modules may give a chance to record a demigod ability for a decisive moment.
- Combat advantage:
  - can fight while recording enemy Beyonder abilities, “countering moves with moves.”

### One-time use problem and recovery

- Recording is one-time use.
- After combat, the Apprentice often expends all recorded abilities and enters a severe slump:
  - abilities blank,
  - “a blade that burns hot for a moment,”
  - requiring a very, very long time to recover.
- Practical play:
  - weigh use of abilities in combat,
  - preserve critical abilities as a backhand,
  - stockpile during downtime.

### Teleportation and high Sequence travel

- Mid-to-high Apprentices have among the strongest survival abilities: teleportation.
- Effects:
  - extraordinary escape,
  - appear anywhere to launch attacks,
  - high-speed blink,
  - can fulfill encirclement/flanking movement alone while others cannot respond.
- Higher Sequences:
  - roam the starry sky,
  - teleport through the **Astral World**,
  - travel among planets,
  - record alien pathway abilities beyond the 22 pathways.
- Starry sky danger:
  - extremely dangerous,
  - corruption risk; “power and risk walk together.”

> **GM Note:** The text recommends Apprentices more for campaigns starting at Sequence 6 if Players don’t want the low-Sequence “hard to bring force to bear” experience.

## Error

- Described as fragile and difficult-to-use.
- Before demigod:
  - lacks effective defense **Rank**,
  - attack ability is only a dagger,
  - “cannot even beat a pack of dogs” without preparation (disguise as owner or parasitize a dog).
- Emphasis:
  - low-Sequence mental interference comparable to Psychological Invisibility,
  - excellent disguise, thought misdirection, investigation,
  - can show prowess through intelligence abilities even before Sequence 6.

### Sequence abilities (overview)

- Low-Sequence: focuses on fraud.
  - fraud infiltrates scenes and swindles intelligence.
  - Sleight of Hand can obtain important plot items.
  - Cryptology Scholar can obtain key intelligence, increase understanding of a person, and crack disguises.
- Starting at Sequence 6:
  - can participate in combat by stealing Beyonder abilities.
  - requires heavy early preparation:
    - false contact, pretend closeness, then erupt,
    - steal the opponent’s most critical ability in one go,
    - enemy losing a key ability has greatly reduced combat power.
- Risk profile:
  - do not consider prolonged frontal combat.
  - preparation, premeditation, fraud, deception are “the truth of this pathway.”
- Sequence 5 “seizing” looks strong, but Error “begins to exert itself” from Sequence 4:
  - possess others,
  - steal lifespan,
  - be nearly immortal.
  - to low-Sequence Beyonders, this may look like an “opportunity,” but is “nourishment” for an Error demigod’s possession.
- High Sequences:
  - ceiling for defrauding rules is high.
  - Error demigods must prepare for an enemy: Amon.

> **GM Note:** “It requires a very proficient player to produce effect.”

## Visionary

- Strength among the top, but actual performance is polarized.
- Suitable for Players who are meticulous, mind-interested, and have logic/creativity.

### Roleplaying (Audience emphasis)

- Visionary emphasizes psychological guidance and arranging from behind the scenes.
- Low-Sequence Visionary is strong with reasonable arrangements, but tests associative ability.
- Poor roleplay risk: treating the Audience as a tool-person (strong but lacking spectacle).

**Example contrast (keep logic explicit)**
- “Not suited” example:
  - “I want to use psychological guidance to arrange for George to buy an apple.”
- “Suited” example:
  - A detailed chain of mood, preferences, stimulus (discount), desire, behavior change, and incidental intelligence gathering via the fruit-stand owner.

Guidance:
- Describe your logic in roleplay; “reasonable” runs through the text.
- Think divergently and from others’ perspectives; guide imperceptibly.
- Remember: you are an Audience, not an actor.
  - hide in the crowd,
  - avoid drawing attention,
  - do not rush into fights,
  - watch in secret and guide the situation.

### Sequence abilities (overview)

- Early fragility in numbers:
  - At Sequence 7, it can only gain **1 point of Agility**.
  - Before Sequence 6, Visionary does not obtain any defense **Rank**.
- GM targeting guidance:
  - the GM should not attack Visionary first because it looks harmless; teammates look more threatening.
  - unless the Player does something suicidal, this Sequence should be the last to die in the party.
- Mind-reading:
  - can break poorly designed scenarios,
  - but even at Sequence 2 it stays at surface thoughts:
    - cannot directly know secrets/important things,
    - can infer personality and obvious dissatisfaction/malice,
    - can read current surface thoughts.
  - deeper results require step-by-step psychological guidance to lower defenses; usually a long process.
- GM support for fun:
  - provide complete, complex, vast psychological secrets;
  - if insufficient, focus on NPC gossip to avoid crucial parts as second-best.

## Tyrant

- Powerful combat-type Sequence:
  - early high defensive capability; can bear a lot of damage,
  - excellent damage; reckless-brawler early role.
- Not suitable for investigation-focused campaigns:
  - before Sequence 3, basically no intelligence capability.
- Damage relies on Rage:
  - only a Tyrant who falls into Rage outputs truly excellent damage,
  - but loses self-control and may be constrained by fear of this.
- Needs good timing for Rage and coordination (mind-domain teammate) to release Rage when unnecessary.
- Otherwise may fall into traps due to uncontrollable anger.

### Sequence notes

- At Sequence 5:
  - damage begins to show strongly.
  - under higher physical defense across pathways, lightning and light damage still have high priority even at demigod stage.
  - lightning speed can ignore Agility and evasion values in a target’s physical defense, increasing hit rate and effectively cutting physical defense.
  - demands skill value related to singing; learn in advance or Ocean Songster may be decorative.
  - can use Arrow of Lightning to draw lightning and strengthen thunder damage.
  - optional concept: elf-blooded descendant using a bow to shoot thunder.
- Defense progression:
  - as Sequences increase, Tyrant “quickly can no longer keep up” at the same Sequence.
- Mortal Tyrants:
  - described as fragile turrets.
  - shine mainly at sea; can work on land but tests familiarity.
  - main shining moments in low-to-mid Sequences.
  - after Mortal:
    - speed can break the sound barrier,
    - but disaster ability ranges are too large and become constrained,
    - especially on land: may have strength but cannot present it.
- Sea King pathway:
  - can remain in any sea area and pour wrath onto any Beyonder entering it.

## Sun Pathway

- Damage + support; damage not always outstanding, but strong against undead.
- Has precious dispel capability (shadows/curses).

### Sequence abilities (overview)

- Support can be “the stronger the stronger, the weaker the weaker,” premised on a **Beyonder Item**.
- Example synergy claim:
  - if a combat-pathway Sequence 7 Beyonder obtains a Beyonder Item equivalent to Sun pathway Sequence 7 (Moon is recommended),
  - it can produce “1+1 is greater than 2.”
- Benefits named:
  - evasion bonus,
  - holy bonus,
  - flame bonus,
  - improving physical defense and damage.
- Claim:
  - if paired well, a **7+7** Beyonder may very likely reach close to the level of Sequence 5,
  - but this does not mean they should participate in Sequence 5 combat.
- Risk statement:
  - even with Sun evasion bonuses, Sequence 5 combat is perilous because a Sequence 7 Beyonder Item cannot change the fundamental fragility of a Sequence 7 Beyonder’s HP.
  - without enough survival capability, this playstyle is “walking a tightrope.”
- If already Sequence 5, choosing a Sun pathway Beyonder Item is an excellent choice.
- “Wicked” coverage:
  - excels when facing wicked, but modules almost never have absolutely no wicked-type existence.
  - Examples listed: Hanged Man, Abyss, Moon, Mutant, Death.
- Sequence 6 notarization:
  - outstanding even against non-wicked enemies; improves survival.
- Sequence 4 qualitative change:
  - Spear of No Darkness (see related copy for details).
  - Domain of No Darkness extracts/purifies Beyonder Characteristics; highly sought-after demigod-level ability.
- Combat table feel:
  - frequent dice rolling hopes to produce more great successes (“Praise the Sun”) to provide team buffs.

### Roleplaying (Art: Singing example)

> **GM Note:** When Players use the Sun pathway’s singing skill, sufficient roleplay during use of **Art: Singing** is encouraged to increase immersion.

**Example case (kept as provided)**
- A Reinforcer-completed character who survived from the Third Epoch to the present, appears as a girl (vampire looks fixed) but is emotionally indifferent—a priest.
- Believer of the Ancient Sun God in the Third Epoch (when the Ancient Sun God ruled the world; all races believed).
- Now a Moon pathway Sequence 7 who believes in the Sun God and possesses a Sun pathway Beyonder Item from back then; described as a “7+7 Beyonder.”
- Was once a demigod; repeated feigned deaths caused retreat to Sequence 7.

Roleplay approach:
- Ancient Hermes Language is described as not suitable to use Chinese directly; to preserve distance and ancient feel, translate the chant into another language (Arabic recommended), send it once, then immediately attach the meaning, sending twice:

> "Ancient sun god, let us sing the song of the guardian; the eternal creator, please give the flaming sun above decay."  
> (The eternal Sun God, let us sing the song of guardianship;  
> Eternal Creator, please grant your creation the blazing sun above decay)

- Note in example: “Of course, when facing real Arabs, do not do this; it is recommended to switch to another language (lol).”
- If not a believer of the Ancient Sun God but of the Eternal Blazing Sun, change the text.

Additional warning:
- Sun pathway Beyonders have the Beyonder ability **Body of Radiance**.
- Divining Mortal Sun pathway Beyonders will produce severe consequences.
- Never look directly at Mortal Sun pathway Beyonders during combat.

## Reader Pathway

- Suitable for Players with meticulous logical thinking, interest in detective concepts, and love of knowledge.
- Abilities are framed around profiling, deduction, inference, and memory palace.

### Roleplaying

- High ceiling, low floor.
  - strong logic Players can make low-Sequence Readers into “powerhouse among powerhouses,”
  - otherwise may roleplay into a simple martial fighter.
- No specific module type is inherently suitable/unsuitable; depends on Player.
- Reader can fit investigation, combat, or adventure; can take the role.
- Reader’s advantage: use intelligence and information acquisition as “softness as steel.”

**Example (tailing snake)**
- Low-Sequence Beyonders of other pathways struggle against a local snake familiar with terrain tailing them.
- A qualified Reader:
  - identifies situation quickly,
  - profiles/deduces, predicts route,
  - uses certain Beyonder abilities to grasp terrain,
  - walks reverse route to intercept/encircle.

Team role:
- A qualified Sequence 7 Reader should be the think-tank and cannot always stay behind; must occasionally act alone with strong independent action capability.

Claimed capability example:
- A Sequence 7 Reader can set a trap for a Sequence 5 Abyss, lure them in, and win through wisdom.

### Sequence abilities

- Starting at Sequence 6:
  - can turn knowledge into power, simulating abilities of all 22 pathways.
  - even if effect is halved, ceiling is extremely high.
  - no limit on number of uses; “equivalent to having all 22 pathways unlocked.”
  - can observe and simulate alien pathways.
- Starting at demigod:
  - “Prophecy” via logical inference is difficult to treat as divination; described as big-data computation of outcomes.
- Synergy emphasis:
  - combining abilities of different pathways is highly in-demand.
  - Example claims:
    - an official Sequence 7 squad can be confident killing at sea a Sequence 6 pirate general carrying a Sequence 5 Hanged Man Beyonder Item.
    - a Sequence 4 Reader can use Mythical Creature Form to force back demigods of Warrior and Earth pathways.
- Other notes:
  - Readers can obtain many trained skills; relatively comprehensive.
  - Re-rolls make hit rate very high.
  - Halving of simulated ability effects means Readers often lack damage; even at demigod may rely on firearms.
  - Readers need damage-oriented Beyonder Items.
  - Broad but not specialized.

## Hanged Man Pathway

- Low-Sequence: summoner; deals curse damage; creates flesh creations that attack everything around and are extremely difficult to kill.
- Has abilities that are neither strong nor weak; easy to lose sanity.
- Mortal Hanged Man is among the strongest damage-bearers.

### Mid-Sequence durability and kit

- Immortal flesh:
  - at Sequence 6 has at least **80 HP**.
- Excess flesh stacking enables:
  - flesh cloak to block damage,
  - tear off own arm to make a bomb,
  - flesh magic to heal.
- Can collapse into a pool of flesh to infiltrate through places normally impassable.
- Appearance change has deceptive value.
- With preplanned methods (drilling into others’ bodies, controlling flesh creatures to transmit messages), a mid-Sequence Hanged Man has relatively comprehensive investigation and output.

### Drawbacks and constraints

- “Art style” is SAN-dropping and may be resisted; character concept hard to control.
- Before Sequence 6:
  - almost no output capability,
  - flesh bombs have usage limits,
  - must accumulate flesh in advance for battles (ambush or other means), without being discovered (avoiding official attention).
- Flesh creatures are like marionettes; at equal-level combat hard to be decisive.
- “Only an idiot would let a Hanged Man stand beside them and spend a full-round action drilling into their body.”
- Output relies heavily on shepherd’s grazed souls:
  - grazing souls is Sequence 5,
  - may not find suitable souls.
- From Sequence 6 can “face sculpt” like Faceless, but far inferior.

### GM restrictions guidance

- Generally not recommended to forbid Hanged Man by default; an investigator who may be antagonistic can increase fun.
- Exceptions exist for plot needs; the GM should ask the Player’s reasons and roleplay tendencies and communicate.
- If a Player is purely causing trouble, forbidding may be considered.

## Death Sequence

- Specialized in countering undead; summoner + meat-tank.
- Sequence 8:
  - **10** cold and curse resistance.
- Sequence 7:
  - further has **7 armor**.
- Emphasizes armor rather than high-speed evasion; effective in specific occasions.

### Notes on defense environment

- Agility/evasion in physical defense can be ignored by bullets, creating near-unavoidable situations.
- Lightning and light speed at mid Sequences can balance high-speed evasion.
- Death “does not need to care” about Agility/evasion being ignored because it emphasizes armor; armor-ignoring abilities are “usually relatively few.”

### Strengths and drawbacks

- Mid-Sequence: can build undead armies.
- Mortal: can summon Underworld creatures; creates oppressive pressure.
- Drawback:
  - aside from undead armies/domain, lacks good attack methods.
  - if undead army is abolished and abilities are stolen, even a Sequence 5 Death may only draw a sword and brawl.
- Needs a Beyonder Item to supplement itself.
  - “Best not to consider Sun”:
    - undead creatures are completely countered by Sun pathway;
    - holding a Sun pathway Beyonder Item is effectively suicide for Death.
- Severe suppression of higher over lower:
  - a higher-ranking Death/undead before you makes you tremble and unable to resist; you can only do what they say, even suicide.
  - conversely, you can impose this on weaker undead.

## Night

- Suitable for Players interested in poetry, dreams, secrecy, silence.
- Advantage:
  - can act 24 hours; nighttime as main stage.
  - dream entry is extremely strong support at mid and Mortal.

### Dream entry and restraint

- A person pulled into a dream is regarded as restrained.
  - Most attacks against them are regarded as guaranteed hits.
- Dream content must be reasonable, or suspicion may be aroused.
- In PvP, Night must make the dream not feel out of place.

### Sequence 8 team movement boost

- Sequence 8 is among the few that can provide all teammates with an extra movement action.
- Extra movement action enables:
  - maintaining at least one special action continuously,
  - continuously gaining benefits/bonuses from special actions.
- Examples given (special actions consume a movement action):
  - charge-up strike check **+2**,
  - borrowed-object protection armor **+2**.
- Effect framing:
  - “directly adding a +2 bonus as the final check for everyone,”
  - does not affect original actions,
  - everyone’s movement doubles,
  - strong in group and individual combat.
- Claim:
  - a Beyonder squad with Night support can attempt to contend against enemies two Sequence levels higher (excluding mid-Sequence versus demigod).

### Drawbacks and coordination

- Besides dream entry, not very good survival capability.
- Spirit Witch must wait until Sequence 5 to attempt to obtain abilities of other pathways.
- Needs Beyonder Items for survival and output to strengthen combat power.
- Needs teammates; should not strike alone unless absolutely confident.
- Negative effects of dream entry can cause danger at key moments.
- Only at Mortal does Night have truly powerful darkness control and secrecy abilities.

### GM and campaign fit

- Excellent investigation methods via dream entry at night (investigation, interrogation, digesting potions).
- In dreams, the dream-entered person usually cannot lie.
- As an official member, Night’s abilities manifest as office workers maintaining public order.
- Suitable for medium-difficulty case-investigation campaigns with repeated dream entry to find truth.
- In adventure, positioning somewhat similar to Audience:
  - loses powerful mind-reading,
  - but has stronger physical damage and support.

## Warrior

- Reckless-brawler; plain sturdiness.
- Among the ceilings of frontal combat early and late (especially before demigod).
- Weapons mastery:
  - proficient in any offensive skill, saving skill-point allocations.
  - high attack checks; against insufficient Agility opponents, attacks are “guaranteed hits,” each strike a grievous wound.
- Special attack actions allow one-versus-many; charging into an army is possible.

### Sequence progression notes

- Before Sequence 6:
  - should avoid prolonged combat.
- At Sequence 6:
  - qualitative change in protection; formally strong attack + damage-bearing.
  - combined with huge body from low Sequence, becomes the only pure melee role.
- At demigod:
  - somewhat disadvantaged due to general enhancement of other pathways.
  - excels at frontal combat, but opponents avoid head-on fights.
  - needs a mobility Beyonder Item (what it lacks most), though Mortal strength remains high even without one.
- Anti-caster:
  - if an opponent uses a casting action, Warrior can instantly charge and inflict a grievous wound.
  - Mortal is still a mage’s nemesis.
- Utility:
  - can eliminate supernatural effects.
  - Mortal Hide in Reflected Light enables assassin-like ambushes mid-combat.
- Output:
  - stable and lasting via special attack actions:
    - continuous strike for single-unit output,
    - whirlwind slash to rush into crowds.
- Regret:
  - early damage is mainly physical; feels unconvincing against certain Sequences/monsters.

## Black Emperor

- Suitable for Players with real-world inspiration, strong associative ability, many ideas.
- Low-Sequence: support + defense; influence via distortion, rhetoric, rage strike.
- Sequence 7: Bribery + later “distortion” show dominance.

### Bribery (core confrontation tool)

- Throw an item at a target—whether they catch it or not, they are regarded as having been bribed.
- Only high-mobility abilities can evade this area.
- Once bribed, the target usually:
  - has all damage reduced, or
  - suffers tracking, or
  - suffers other “disgusting” effects.

### Distortion (Sequence 6 and beyond)

- Sequence 6 distorts rules with high ceiling and openness:
  - “closing a door” → “sealing space”
  - “retreating” → “running away”
  - “split up” → “act separately”
- General principle:
  - distort the meaning of something into a close meaning, and the distorted thing becomes reality.
- Tests the Player’s association:
  - without talent, may be at a loss,
  - with strong association, becomes highly influential in battle.

Multi-person melee:
- performs excellently:
  - can modify casting targets,
  - the more chaotic, the better.
- Examples:
  - distort walking intent into running, forcing full movement and pulling away,
  - distort lighting a single area into lighting the entire area, amplifying a flame-type ability to light the whole room.

### Distortion vs Error (principle difference)

- Black Emperor distortion is not the same as Error high-Sequence fraud:
  - similar results, different principles and scopes.
- Example comparison:
  - Black Emperor might distort blood into part of flesh, but it is not a complete body and cannot bear resurrection of a spirit body; cannot be a resurrection point.
  - Error can directly make part of blood = a complete body.
- Summary as provided:
  - Error draws an equals sign between two things sharing core content that is completely the same, usually without action factors (e.g., blood = complete body).
  - Black Emperor changes one thing into another with a similar meaning, usually an action (language/intent/bodily action).
- Sequence 4 “chaos” is not discussed.

### Mortal notes

- Still powerful with variable uses:
  - can let a Sequence 5 ability leap to Sequence 4 level,
  - many abilities to interfere.
- Requires good judgment and rhetoric; suited for high-IQ-type players.

## Justiciar

- Not-weak combat power plus extremely strong support.
- Roleplay: promulgating edicts is solemn/cool; suited to Players who read/follow news politics, ethics, morality, law, current affairs.
- No hard mismatch; “only people more suitable for roleplay.”
- Players should have some sense of justice.

### Combat notes

- Low Sequences:
  - strong one-on-one suppression:
    - Beyonder combat + mental piercing can imbalance/shock opponent.
    - if opponent cannot obtain other actions, it is almost equivalent to skipping a round.
- Jurisdiction:
  - in own jurisdiction, gains very high bonuses.
  - will try to have combat erupt within their jurisdiction.
- Sequence 6:
  - crucial ability: “Law of All Arts”
  - adds crimes to enemies through promulgating laws to deal higher damage or apply negative buffs.
- Targeting focus:
  - combat and support target criminals.
- Role obligations:
  - high-pathway Justiciars must join an official-type organization; high-pathway Justiciar is team-type.
- Demigod combat:
  - a Sequence 6 can restrain a demigod within certain limits.
  - Sequence 4: full-area anti-magic described as similar to a Scranton Reality Anchor: “mysticism weakens here, reality strengthens,” used by human militaries against Beyonders.
- Fit:
  - fits most campaigns but best with some combat elements; otherwise edicts are hard to use effectively.

## Red Priest

- Powerful combat-oriented Sequence.
- Low Sequences:
  - offensive capability relatively weak due to low HP,
  - still has some combat ability.
- Mid-to-high Sequences:
  - top-tier damage output.

### Sequence abilities (overview)

- Low Sequences: trap-setter and provocateur.
- Mid Sequences:
  - team’s top damage dealer (“strongest spear”).
  - high Agility (DEX), abundant skill points, some investigative ability.
  - suitable for story-focused and combat-focused play.
- Compared to Tyrant/Demon:
  - focuses on frequent attacks and easier-to-hit targets,
  - rather than enemies difficult to hit.
- Survivability:
  - low HP, but high Agility (DEX) and armor from the fireground:
    - looks fragile but not easy to kill.
- Damage sources:
  - mainly fire damage and Premeditated.
  - struggles against high fire resistance or high physical defense.
- GM counterpicks suggested:
  - Fool, Demon, Tyrant:
    - enemies whose damage doesn’t rely on low Strength (STR),
    - but on stacking Premeditated damage after multiple hits.
- Attribute tendency (as provided):
  - prioritize Agility (DEX),
  - Strength (STR) secondary,
  - Intuition (INT) after that,
  - but do not underestimate Intuition (INT), especially with many targets.
- Tactical guidance:
  - avoid close combat (potions grant higher Agility than Strength).
  - shooting skills recommended over brawling.
  - against high physical defense:
    - prepare Stealth,
    - use Stealth-based evasion to gain Conspiracy action bonus,
    - can combine with provocation.

### Roleplay

- High-Sequence often needs an army; difficult to depict outside war settings.
- High-Sequence alternatives:
  - obtain Fool Pathway Beyonder Items that can create marionettes,
  - use Death Pathway undead army,
  - or form a small team with other Players.
- Formula availability:
  - most formulas can only be obtained at sea.
  - Red Priest found in island chains like Bayam or among military.
  - hard to see in Backlund; shines where order is in turmoil.
- Suggested roles: assassins, mercenaries, etc.
- In combat-heavy scenarios, mid-to-late Red Priest can show “dumbfounding” damage output.

## Witch

- Assassin-type; troublesome enemy at mid-to-low Sequence.
- Low Sequences rely on assassin style: hide in dark, charge up, burst-kill.
- By Sequence 8:
  - comparable to a Sequence 4 Spectator “Manipulator” for incitement power in effect (with only one or two sentences causing conflict and bloodshed).
- Example:
  - tell a stranger someone insulted his wife; incitement intensifies anger; he goes to kill someone who never did it.
- Proper incitement can turn a helpless person into a slave willing to die.
- Incitement is far inferior to Sequence 4 Spectator, but terrifying at Sequence 8.

### Social environment fit

- More chaotic places and people lacking goals improve effect.
- Hard to perform in orderly places.
- Nobles are difficult to shake; slums/chaotic order makes Witch equivalent to a Sequence 4 Manipulator.

### Combat

- Damage:
  - skills have relatively low base damage.
  - if Witch gains “advantage” on attacks, sneak attack increases spell damage and attack damage at the same time.
- Cursecraft:
  - rare unlimited-range damage skill at low Sequences.
  - if you obtain flesh/blood of creatures, you can curse them from a safe place without limit.
- Touch of Pleasure:
  - instant-death effect via drawing out enough Spirituality to drive the target insane.
- Survival:
  - Mirror Substitute uses victim’s Spirituality maximum; makes Witch difficult to kill.
- From Sequence 7:
  - kit is comprehensive; invisibility enables repeated ambushes; Sequence 7 Witch is troublesome.
- Sequence 5 Witch:
  - under Plague Aura:
    - Mirror Substitute,
    - Wand Substitute,
    - abilities like Primordial Cocoon layered for survival,
    - Plague Aura ignores obstacles and continuously applies disease.
  - To kill:
    - must fight fast; prolonged fight is extremely unfavorable.
    - prolonged fight infects and weakens you; fast fight runs into substitute defenses.

### Roleplay

- Biggest problem: Primordial Witch and the Witch Church.
  - recruit mostly originally male; formulas hard to obtain; Cheek may influence you.
  - forced transition may be unacceptable; pathway rarely chosen.
- Two roleplay approaches (Pain Witch):
  - inflict pain on others, or
  - make yourself experience pain.
- At high Sequences, must hurt countless people; Players with conscience may struggle to advance past Sequence 7.
- Erotic themes note:
  - suits Players with some taste for erotic themes, but cannot be only that.
  - requires wisdom; has verbal-technique domains like incitement.
- Mid-Sequence trait:
  - overwhelmed by love; “a Witch dies of love.”
- If advanced from male:
  - must roleplay as a woman but remember you were originally male; losing self-positioning may cause loss of control.
  - the “other half” to roleplay is not gender-defined; depends on you.

## Abyss

- Outputs via toxins, fire, physical damage, curses.
- High-HP bonus makes Abyss an uncompromising melee mage.

### Sequence abilities

- Low Sequences:
  - perform ritual magic to demons for additional mutations,
  - kill continuously,
  - use Broken Wings and demon spells to maneuver around authorities.
- Can use sacrificial rituals for anti-divination/anti-spirit communication:
  - once an Abyss appears, it usually triggers citywide vigilance,
  - especially in Backlund; in Bayam it usually draws Church of Storms attention.
- If you do not create a bloodshed case, usually nothing happens—but that may make choosing Abyss “rather meaningless,” because the pathway is “fated to be accompanied by slaughter.”
- Strong stage: Sequence 6 (abilities take shape).
  - advantage against low-quality monster hordes.
  - struggles against enemies resistant to curses, toxins, and fire.
  - not helpless:
    - Filthy Words lacks excellent accuracy, but effect can surprise.
    - demonization at Sequence 6 gives relatively high resistance to fire, curses, toxins; advantage versus pathways using those damage types.

### Roleplay

- Usually not welcomed by orthodox churches; even villain orgs may not welcome (too ostentatious; rituals eye-catching).
- Exposure leads to other Players and NPCs keeping watch and guarding against crimes.
- More suitable as villain:
  - either seek humanity within corruption (requires deep understanding),
  - or enjoy villain charm; an Abyss “(human body) artist” can portray vividly.
- Abyss appearance usually represents a boss fight.
  - abilities generally apply in group combat.
  - solo-killing an Abyss is very unrealistic.
- Not recommended to forbid Players from choosing Abyss by default (unless determined to cause trouble).
- Table conduct note:
  - villains among Players can add charm, but if “in the name of being a villain” you affect other Players’ mentality rather than normal confrontation, group quality drops.
  - “Even if you are roleplaying, do not indulge your consciousness because of it.”
  - “Mutual respect.”

## Mutant

- Warrior with rich transformative abilities.
- Rare ability to act while in a state of madness.
- Low-Sequence Mutants resemble Abyss:
  - possess trained offensive skills,
  - among best combat pathways.
- Core: Prisoner and indulgence.
- First consideration: indulge or restrain yourself.

### Roleplay (restraint vs indulgence)

- Restraint-oriented:
  - restrain emotions, show little expression,
  - burst suppressed forces at critical moments,
  - reveal Mutant side at the most critical moment.
- Lust-oriented (indulgence-oriented):
  - described as far stronger.
  - can reroll checks without limit until they hit; even a fumble brings only benefits and no drawbacks.
  - crazy/perverse behavior examples provided (including extreme content).
  - not stupid: will suppress rage if impulse would cost life; often careful/cautious.
  - association:
    - generally members of the Rose School of Thought,
    - Mother Tree of Desire takes particular care.

> **GM Note:** The RAW includes explicit, extreme examples for lust-oriented behavior. Handle table tone and consent carefully.

### Sequence abilities

- Extremely high damage and powerful damage-taking.
- Werewolf stage: not many distinctive features.
- Sequence 6 living corpse:
  - reduced fire damage,
  - not afraid of bullets,
  - not afraid of cannon shells,
  - not afraid of critical success,
  - not afraid of bombardment,
  - not afraid of drowning,
  - full-speed sprinting can be faster than a steam train.
- Sequence 5 wraith:
  - Greater Invisibility almost never detected unless facing a Sequence 4 enemy.
  - resistance: physical damage completely ineffective.
  - switching between living corpse and wraith forms takes only a free action.
- Demigod stage:
  - invisibility such that even demigods of same level cannot see it.
- Flaws:
  - output too single at demigod: curses or physical damage only.
  - if enemy’s curse resistance is maxed out, no good solution.
  - at high Sequences, still relies on mid-to-low Sequence forms without qualitative change; painful.
  - puppet form and shapeshifting curse are relatively good but do not solve the reliance issue.

### Additional roleplay notes

- Must choose stance.
- Reference: Miss Sharon’s ethereal/quiet temperament as a wraith is cited as captivating.
- Indulgence-oriented guidance:
  - release momentary thoughts without affecting other Players,
  - appear crazy/perverse but not stupid,
  - more suitable to fight alone or with similar members to avoid being constrained.
- Style reference:
  - female Mutant could suit gothic-style character (Sequence 5 wraith + gothic clothing), but difficulty high for lust-oriented play; avoid resembling Miss Sharon too closely.
- The debate within Mutant: indulgence vs restraint.
- Indulgence leads toward Outer Deities/cosmos/corruption, but is exceptionally powerful before corruption.

## Mystery Pryer

- Currently least tested content; described as low presence in the original work.
- Description may be updated in later versions; players can join the chat group marked on the first page of the rulebook to provide more data.

### Sequence abilities

- Very all-round, largely due to ritual magic.
- Low Sequences (Sequence 9):
  - can borrow roughly Sequence 6-level power from various gods through ritual magic.
  - ritual magic is hard to bring into real combat:
    - requires too much time,
    - easy for enemies to detect,
    - difficult to be decisive.
- Spirit vision:
  - can be turned off at Sequence 4 (unlike Fate, which cannot be turned off at all).
- Mid Sequences:
  - core domain becomes “all kinds of magic.”
  - spells can be interpreted in advance with casting time and charging, then burst when battle begins.
  - spells almost all have CDs due to charging/casting time.
  - encounter fights: rely on instant spells for support.
  - Sequence 6 has scrolls to assist casting.
  - Sequence 5 can be released to the group as the power of the astral world.
- Sequence 4 qualitative change:
  - “Mystical Reenactment” enables customization; each demigod’s reenactment differs based on mastered hidden knowledge.
  - targets facing a Sequence 4 Mystery Pryer may have no idea what abilities they possess; Mystery Pryer also has anti-divination power.
- Higher Sequences:
  - prophecy, information lifeforms, turning knowledge into power and power into knowledge; “high Sequences are the true beginning.”

### Roleplay section

- Must face influence of the Hidden Sage (end of Fourth Epoch and Fifth Epoch):
  - may pour massive knowledge during advancement, causing loss of control.
  - even at Sequence 9, the Hidden Sage may pour knowledge leading to corruption.
- Mystical Reenactment requires understanding hidden knowledge, which is dangerous and entangled with mythological creatures.
- Sequence 4 ritual:
  - hardest and simplest:
    - requires a drop of a mythological creature’s blood,
    - must have a channel to contact at least a Sequence 2 mythological creature,
    - a demigod will not work.
- Suitable target type:
  - transmigrator identity:
    - knows Earth myths,
    - reenactments based on Earth stories are described as safer and exceptionally powerful.
- Positioning:
  - pure mage; even melee involves magic.
  - essence: mystical-side knowledge.
  - Perfected is reality-side knowledge; Reader is application of knowledge (turning knowledge into power).
- Closing line:
  - “Do as you will, but do no harm.”

## Perfected

- Research-inclined, close to “reality side.”
- Best choice for Players interested in science/technology knowledge (physics, chemistry, etc.).
- Team role: supplier/mechanical maker; well-rounded skills.
  - if present, reduces worry about module skill-point coverage.

### Sequence notes

- Sequence 9:
  - tricky/hardcore investigator role (CoC-like).
  - can manufacture simple devices, but needs materials and enough time to assemble.
  - can manufacture firearms, aqua regia, nitroglycerin, and even explosives (no CoC restrictions implied).
  - GM can apply restrictions:
    - at least, a low-Sequence Perfected should not casually produce overly excessive explosives and rifles,
    - dynamic adjustments based on group needs.
  - after Sequence 9, inclinations focus on history/exploration; qualitative change at Sequence 6.
- Sequence 6:
  - steampunk flavor:
    - can manufacture mechanical mystical items (spring-loaded fists, steam-powered fists),
    - may build short-range drones and jetpacks.
  - can manufacture Beyonder Items and reduce negative effects to a minimum.
  - artisan status:
    - represents usable Beyonder Items rather than severely negative Sealed Artifacts.
    - attracts protection; tied to shared interests; many will protect.
  - forging economy:
    - when others obtain a Beyonder characteristic, they commission forging; payment high.
    - price for manufacturing a single Beyonder item ranges from **£500 to £1,500**.
  - practical implication:
    - Perfected usually carries multiple Beyonder Items—at least two—because personal combat capability is low.
- Sequence 5:
  - can perform through power of celestial bodies.
- Sequence 4:
  - can alter physical properties,
  - can manufacture an intelligent robot identical to themselves.
  - a Sequence 4 Perfected may be a mechanical “Iron Man,” extending steam nozzles or popping firearms to strafe (humanoid Gundam / AI framing).
- Additional:
  - even at low Sequence, can enhance level of Beyonder Items in hand, suppress negative effects, seek undiscovered Beyonder Items.
  - ideal for investigation groups exploring ancient ruins; pass items through Perfected hands to maximize effectiveness.

## Moon

- Low-Sequence: support.
- Starting at Sequence 7: excellent all-rounder combining damage, support, control, survival.
- Framed via vampires/Blood Clan commonness.

### Sequence abilities and roleplay

- Moon/Earth are life Pathways; Blood Clan in this setting are not violent; respect life; obtain blood via reasonable channels.
- Reverse acting exists:
  - some “slaughter” life; mostly outside Blood Clan, in Rose School of Thought, independent, or artificial vampires advanced from ordinary people; believers of Primordial Moon.
- Potion-making:
  - restore life,
  - provide attribute buffs,
  - deal damage.
- Support claim:
  - at Sequence 9, a qualified apothecary can solve the plague of a Sequence 5 Disease Witch with a single bottle of potion.
- Sequence 6:
  - can indirectly use other Pathways’ abilities,
  - can pre-buff before battle,
  - can brew potions on the spot during battle via Siphon Life blood from enemies:
    - produce potions equivalent to part of target’s abilities (ability replication).
- Sequence 7:
  - only mid-to-low Sequence pathway stated to possess “resurrection.”
  - can increase a Beyonder’s lifespan to **300 years**.
- Sequence 7 control/support tools listed:
  - Abyss Shackles,
  - Pain Torture,
  - Claws of Corrosion.
- Physical capability:
  - can have speed leaving afterimages at Sequence 7.
  - Blood Clan physicality exceeds common sense; can do movements not possible under common sense (e.g., forcibly changing direction midair, whipping up a gale head-on).
- Beast tamer:
  - pets or blood thralls provide buffs.
  - in a Moon workshop with many animals: “one person is an entire unit.”
- Blood thralls:
  - kind-hearted Players often avoid due to ethical/moral issues and ongoing risk of loss of control or harm.

### Becoming a Moon Pathway character (access and ethics)

- Recommended not to start from Sequence 9:
  - Blood Clan are naturally Sequence 7,
  - Moon characteristics are almost monopolized by Blood Clan,
  - if no characteristics flow out, main potion ingredient cannot be obtained/purchased.
- If starting from Sequence 9, reaching Sequence 7 likely forces hunting a Blood Clan member (may be innocent), creating ethical burden.
- Hunting Blood Clan to advance makes you an artificial vampire (Sequence 7) and marks you for life as hunted by the Blood Clan.
- Alternatives:
  - build a naturally Sequence 7 Blood Clan member:
    - does not need acting digestion after reaching adulthood; Sequence 7 potion fully digested because they are vampires.
  - advance from Sequence 9 to 7 by accepting a Blood Clan member’s Embrace:
    - change name/identity,
    - join a Blood Clan family.
- Scarcity:
  - Sequence 7 Moon characteristics and even Beyonder items are usually scarce.
- High-Sequence kill condition framing:
  - hard to kill:
    - must first use a dispelling effect to dispel the Moon and fight under moonlight.
  - dispersing body into moonlight is described as romantic.

## Earth

- Powerful healer; can modify biological limbs; also powerful cultivator.
- Earth Church belief: all things are essentially plants; “dust to dust, soil to soil.”
- Suitable for Players interested in research/experiments:
  - mid-Sequence biological experiments,
  - low-Sequence plant cultivation.

### Combat/support notes

- Low-Sequence:
  - provides lasting attribute buffs and healing buffs to the team.
- Sequence 7:
  - guaranteed one-round hard control.
- Plant domain:
  - manipulation can serve as strong damage and support.
- Constraint:
  - needs to carry seeds and grow them before battle to create a vegetation field; otherwise difficult to发挥作用.
  - struggles in encounter battles.
  - greatly dislikes Red Priest:
    - Red Priest can instantly burn Earth plants to ashes.
- Plague domain:
  - nemesis; with Earth, you usually don’t need to worry about a Witch’s plague aura unless the opponent is a full Rank above you.
- Spirituality consumption:
  - severe, but Earth can extract Spirituality from the earth to compensate.
- Diversity:
  - mid-to-high Earth modifies/creates species; abilities diverse.
- Sequence 4 relation to Perfected:
  - correspond but are different aspects; cannot be swapped.
- Roleplay consideration:
  - influence of the Fallen Mother Goddess; see Earth Church in “Organization Introduction” for details.
  - wild Earth Beyonder represents hidden danger; may receive “oracles.”
- High Sequence:
  - can send souls back to earth; nemesis of undead.
  - Sequence 4 becomes research-inclined healer and summoner, but needs sufficient space for research species.
  - example SAN-dropping products:
    - cows growing like wheat,
    - ship cannons producing milk.

## Fate

- Extremely polarized pathway; performs prominently at low Sequence.
- Players should define how they view/feel/follow fate (go with flow vs resist vs balance; “all within fate”).

### Sequence abilities

- Low Sequence:
  - greatest advantage: intuitive dodge.
  - Spirituality consumption is relatively high.
  - each intuitive dodge can:
    - dodge bullets,
    - dodge lightning,
    - gain advantage in special-action contests.
  - thin-blood condition at low Sequence urgently needs this.
- Sequence 8 “Machine”:
  - comprehensively increases Fate’s power.
  - in Sequence 9–8 stage, combat improvement makes Fate a leader among low-Sequence martial skill and prediction.
- Flaw:
  - physical enhancement only occurs once (Machine stage); no more afterward.
- Sequence 7 onward:
  - shifts positioning toward Luck and the calamity of Sequence 6.
- Sequence 5:
  - strength truly unlocked; can fight even a demigod if lucky enough.
  - demigod can rapidly consume a Sequence 5’s Luck via fierce attacks and then kill.
  - Sequence 5 Fate must accumulate enough good luck to erupt decisively at a critical moment.
- Combat fit:
  - not suited for combat; from mid Sequence greatly needs a Beyonder Item or will struggle to发挥作用 in combat.
  - Calamity is indiscriminate and will坑 teammates, leading to few willing teammates.
  - if cannot use calamity, lacks “Beyonder-meaningful” methods in combat.
- Non-combat benefits:
  - “failure is also luck, success is also luck.”
  - can sometimes ask the GM for a stroke of luck to pick up money on the road.
  - if luck is good enough, may obtain a Beyonder Item with not much negative effect.

### Roleplay and safety constraints

- Mid-Sequence Fate should prioritize survival and concealment:
  - hide, change locations frequently, avoid discovery.
  - has divination and anti-divination; with Luck and relocation, even discovered enemies find it hard to kill.
- Pursuit:
  - currently pursued by members of the Rose School of Thought due to Fate Council split.
- High-Sequence Fate:
  - no exact data; may represent changes in game rules (great success reversal, dice chaos).
  - Sequence 2 can, to a certain extent, foresee the future.
- Spirit Vision constraint:
  - at mid-to-low Sequence, Fate Spirit Vision can only see a person’s Luck/misfortune.
  - Fate cannot look directly at a Mythical Creature existence; would go insane on the spot.
  - on first encounter, Spiritual intuition forces you (first time only) not to open your eyes.
  - afterward, inattention may trigger an **SC**.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “SC” is not defined in this excerpt.]]
- Demigod and above:
  - can roughly see direction of fate flow (general, not clear).
  - Sequence 1 can notice abnormal signs and make prophecies; prophecies may be affected by other fate-related abilities.
- Rituals:
  - “simplest and hardest”:
    - with good luck, easy to become a demigod,
    - with bad luck/time, an entire life may be wasted.
- Core problem:
  - Fate Spirit Vision cannot be turned off even at high Sequence, but can be blocked.
  - first priority: avoid seeing things you should not see and learning things you should not learn.
- Framing:
  - the world’s essence is chaotic/insane/abnormal; Fate watches/guards these monsters so the world looks normal.
  - Fate has no adjacent Pathway to swap with; watchers are lonely by nature.
  - “You are also a monster. This, too, is part of Fate.”
