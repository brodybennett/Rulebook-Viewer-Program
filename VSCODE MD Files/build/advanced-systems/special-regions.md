# Chapter Twelve: Special Regions

## Spirit World

### Description

The **Spirit World** is a mystical world that completely overlaps with the real world. It can be understood as two worlds superimposed in the same “position,” but the Spirit World does not directly appear in reality and is considered to be in a hidden state, accessible only by certain methods.

### Access Methods

This includes, but is not limited to:

- Turning oneself into a spirit body.
- Finding an entrance to the Spirit World in reality.
- Finding an entrance through divination.
- Directly opening a door to the Spirit World through the means of the “door.”

### Environment and Landforms

When you arrive in the Spirit World, you see a boundless, primitive area with no man-made buildings. There may be wilderness, cliffs, and plains, but it is obviously different from the real world:

- There are no grasslands and other types of flora and fauna.
- The overall “ecology” can be treated as similar to the deep sea—like a boundless seabed area. This reference can be used directly.

### The Seven Lights of the Spirit World

In the highest sky of the Spirit World, there are overlapping auroras of seven colors, extending to the other end of the world. Above them is endless gray fog.

These seven auroras represent seven mysterious existences that are friendly to humans: the **Seven Lights of the Spirit World**.

- They are synonymous with knowledge.
- Unlike other extraordinary creatures, they are very willing to teach humans.
- They belong to the “great master above the Spirit World.”
- They have incarnations in human society, such as teachers or professors.

If you desire mystical knowledge, you can use them as summoning targets in [[LINK LATER: Ritual Magic | type=ritual | hint=summoning/prayer procedures]], chant the corresponding **Honorable Name**, and pray for what you wish to know.

#### Caution: Knowledge by Possession

The way the Seven Lights impart knowledge is essentially by possessing you and directly instilling or communicating knowledge into your mind or spirit body.

- When you acquire their knowledge, they also learn your past.
- If you have secrets, be cautious when praying to the Seven Lights.

#### Honorable Name Example (Red Light)

Pray using the Honorable Name of the relevant Light. Example (Red Light):

- The eternal light of the Spirit World;
- personification of endless knowledge;
- The red of authority and will

#### Seven Lights: Colors and Symbolic Knowledge

- **First Light — Red Light:** symbolizes the power of divine will, power, authority, and knowledge
- **Second Light — Indigo Light:** symbolizes love and wisdom
- **Third Light — Green Light:** symbolizes the higher mind, beauty, and harmony
- **Fourth Light — Yellow Light:** symbolizes rationality and adaptation, and produces harmonious light through conflict
- **Fifth Light — Orange Light:** symbolizes practical science, technology, and occult knowledge
- **Sixth Ray — Blue Light:** idealism and devotion
- **Seventh Ray — Fuchsia:** ritual, ceremony, and magic (including [[LINK LATER: Ritual Magic | type=ritual | hint=includes ritual summoning]])

To summon other colors, replace the third line of the Honorable Name with the corresponding symbolic knowledge and color content, and you can summon that Light. No additional lines may be added.

> **GM Note:** The RAW notes that the Seven Lights have “textual research in reality,” and uses that as justification for filling in the color associations even where the original novel did not fully specify them.

#### Depictions

The Seven Lights are usually depicted as old men wearing robes of different colors, but they may also appear in more fantastical forms.

> **GM Note:** For depiction references, see Chapter 4 “Visiting” in the Hanged Man chapter of Volume 7 of the original work (as cited by the RAW).

### Spirit World Creatures

The Spirit World naturally contains countless **Spirit World creatures**. Dead souls that have nowhere else to go after death will eventually return to the Spirit World or the Underworld.

- These creatures can be understood as undead creatures.
- Detailed types can be found in the abilities of the “death path.” [[LINK LATER: Death Pathway | type=pathway | hint=path referenced for undead/spirit creatures]]

Spirit World creatures can be contracted and used as messengers or for other purposes.

#### Appearance and Divination Interference

Spirit World creatures often appear “abnormal” and do not match common sense. Examples include:

- A cat-like spirit creature with a human face, tentacles, and a twisting snake-like body.
- An ethereal creature that appears like a normal fireball but is covered with tentacles.

Some are friendly; some are extremely threatening and hostile to other creatures.

Their existence has an anti-divination effect:

- Divinations that do not have a sufficient “level difference” from the divination target will usually be disturbed.  
  [[UNCLEAR: RAW references a “certain level of difference” required for divination to avoid interference but does not define what constitutes that difference.]]

#### Threat Level and Roaming Risk

You must be vigilant when roaming in the Spirit World:

- The probability of encountering hostile Spirit World creatures is extremely high.
- Even if you do not encounter threats immediately upon entry, exploring deeper makes encounters likely.
- Some creatures may have [[LINK LATER: Sequence | type=term | hint=power ranks]] [[LINK LATER: Pathway | type=term | hint=power routes]] systems, and even if some do not, they may have reached demigod status.

> **GM Note:** RAW note—Spirit World creatures that live in the Spirit World have the ability to travel through it, but some beings that are still “Extraordinary in nature” may not be able to do so even if they can enter. Example given: “the unjust soul of the alien Sequence 5.”  
> [[UNCLEAR: “unjust soul of the alien Sequence 5” is referenced without context or definition.]]

### Navigation, Direction, and Getting Lost

The Spirit World has no clear direction and no concept of up, down, left, right, front, or back. It can be roughly understood as a kind of “four-dimensional space,” with an additional axis that cannot be recognized.

- Without a positioning method like the doorway, the probability of getting lost is almost **90%**.
- The longer you roam, the more likely you will never return.
- You may believe you are going “up” but are actually going “forward,” believe you are going “forward” but are actually going “backward,” and may be unable to find the way you came even when trying to retrace it.

#### Divination in the Spirit World

Divination has some uses in the Spirit World, but it is only auxiliary.

- When lost, it can provide some guidance.
- It cannot function like the Door Pathway to return accurately.
- If the loss is serious enough, even divination may not allow a return.

Only the following are described as able to safely explore and travel with Spirit World travel and location capability:

- **Sequence 5** Traveler of the [[LINK LATER: Door Pathway | type=pathway | hint=spirit world travel/door methods]]
- **Sequence 4** Undead of the [[LINK LATER: Death Pathway | type=pathway | hint=spirit world travel]]
- **Sequence 5** Master of Secret Arts of the [[LINK LATER: Reader Pathway | type=pathway | hint=spirit world travel/location]]

### Correspondence to Reality

Every place in the Spirit World has “products” corresponding to reality, reflected in symbolic meaning.

Examples:

- If there is a ship in a location in reality, in the Spirit World you may see black mist the size of the ship.
- If there is serious pollution in an area in reality, you may see things closer to the “essence” in the Spirit World—things that might shock your sanity.

You may also see an eye, occult beings, and unknown creatures or things.

In general:

- As long as reality exists, there will also be a Spirit World.
- The Spirit World exists based on reality.
- Spirit World scenes can be used as references for the real situation.

### Divination Power and Separation Scenarios

The Spirit World is described as the source of divination power.

- Most power in the “Extraordinary Domain” obtains information from the Spirit World.
- Spirit World information runs through the present, past, and future.
- The essence of divination relies on the Spirit World.
- The essence of using doorways to travel through the Spirit World also relies on the Spirit World.

If completely isolated from the Spirit World:

- Fortune tellers would not be able to divine.
- Door pathways would not be able to travel.

However, the RAW states that reality and the Spirit World are usually not completely separated and can often be used at a shallow level:

- Even if the Spirit World is almost destroyed, or reality is cut off from it, a fortune-teller’s divination is usually not affected because it is “shallow use.”
- The Door Pathway may be unable to “shuttle,” but can still be used for Sequence-based “Through the Wall.”  
  [[UNCLEAR: RAW uses “Sequential ‘Through the Wall’” without defining the term/effect beyond the phrase.]]

If even these do not function, the connection with the Spirit World has been completely cut off.

> **Lore:** The RAW states that before the first era in the world’s history, the Spirit World was once completely destroyed in a disaster; as a result, the current world cannot use divination and similar means to obtain historical information before the first era.

### Territory, Conflict, and Messenger Risk

Spirit World creatures are intelligent and have emotions. They divide territory and expand power.

- You may see a castle belonging to a Spirit World creature.
- You may see Spirit World creatures fighting each other.
- A messenger you have contracted may be robbed.
- A messenger should have sufficient self-protection ability.

### Contracts and Summoning Spirit World Creatures

#### Requirements for Contracting

Contracting creatures in the Spirit World requires:

- The power of the Necromancer Domain, **or**
- The power of the Sun Pathway or Judge Pathway, which can create a contract.  
  [[LINK LATER: Sun Pathway | type=pathway | hint=contract creation]]  
  [[LINK LATER: Judge Pathway | type=pathway | hint=contract creation]]

#### Two Ways to Find a Suitable Creature

1. Summon a creature using a three-segment summoning language through [[LINK LATER: Ritual Magic | type=ritual | hint=three-line summoning]].
2. Go directly to the Spirit World, find a suitable creature, communicate on the spot, and sign a contract.

- The latter is described as extremely dangerous.

#### Summoning Safety: “Clear and Directional” Requests

Summoning Spirit World creatures requires enough clear and directional content.

- If you do not specify whether the summoned Spirit World creature is friendly, it may attack you.
- Even without malicious intent, a creature that is too strong may cause pollution and harm you.

#### Summoning Words (Recommended Form)

The RAW presents an “original work” form regarded as more appropriate:

- I! call in the name of (who)

- Spirits that linger in vanity;

- friendly creatures to drive;

- (Third sentence, condense your request in the same style)

Notes:

- The third sentence specifies what kind of spirit you want to summon.
- If you are not afraid of safety issues, the “friendly creatures” line may be deleted.
- **Summoning words can no longer be increased** (no additional lines may be added).

#### Ending a Summoning

As the summoner, you can end the summoning at any time by saying:

- “I! End this summoning in the name of (who)”

The Spirit World creature will be sent back to the Spirit World immediately.

#### Language Requirement

The entire summoning process must use:

- Ancient Hermes (described as a language that can leverage natural power), **or**
- Other languages that can leverage natural power.

If a Beyonder lacks sufficient mystic knowledge background, they may be unable to perform ritual summons.  
[[LINK LATER: Beyonder | type=term | hint=people with extraordinary powers]]

#### Negotiation and Written Clauses

After a creature is successfully summoned:

- You may discuss what it must do and what reward it asks.
- In a contract-like form, write multiple clauses together on parchment.
- The clauses represent content that must be observed and cannot be violated.
- The clauses must also be written in ancient Hermes or other mystical languages.

#### Witness Name (Binding Authority)

Finally, write the name of the god who witnesses and is responsible for the contract on the parchment, such as:

- the Goddess of the Night  
  [[LINK LATER: Goddess of the Night | type=other | hint=god used as contract witness]]
- the Lord of Storms  
  [[LINK LATER: Lord of Storms | type=other | hint=god used as contract witness]]

If there is no corresponding god to appeal to, you can use:

- the name of the Spirit World, or
- the name of the Underworld

This is described as less binding than a god’s name, but usable as an alternative series.

#### Re-Summoning a Contracted Messenger

After the contract is signed, you can summon the creature again by:

- performing the summoning ceremony again,
- reading the incantation used at the time of signing, and
- replacing the third sentence with “a messenger that belongs to xxx,”

where **xxx** is the name used in the contract.

Additional notes:

- The contracted name does not need to be your real name.
- The contract can identify people through “breath.”
- The spell recognizes only the name used to sign the contract.
- Using the same person’s alias is invalid.

#### Skipping the Process via Crafted Props

If you want to skip the above process, you can entrust a **Sequence 6** of the Perfection Pathway (also called a craftsman) to make reusable props that can be directly summoned and signed.  
[[LINK LATER: Perfection Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Sequence 6 craftsman]]

#### Risk: Overpowering Contracted Creature

> **GM Note:** If the Beyonder creature you contract is far greater than you in strength, it may be able to break the contract’s constraints and harm you.

## Underworld

### Description

The **Underworld** is part of the Spirit World: a unique area opened within it by the ancestor of the phoenix, an ancient god (Death Pathway + Door Pathway) in the second era.  
[[LINK LATER: Death Pathway | type=pathway | hint=underworld authority]]  
[[LINK LATER: Door Pathway | type=pathway | hint=underworld authority]]

Because of the existence of the Underworld:

- Beyonders of the “God of Death Pathway” have the ability of the Underworld within their bodies to accommodate undead.
- At the demigod stage, they can travel through the Spirit World like the Door Pathway.

### Access and Lethality

The Underworld is located within the Spirit World, but finding its entrance is difficult and it cannot be found by ordinary means.

It is described as a country that truly cannot allow living people:

- Undead creatures within are extremely ferocious, bloody, twisted, and disgusting.
- Living beings entering will die on the spot; even a demigod who cannot leave in time will suffer heavy injuries and wither quickly.

Normally, only Beyonders of the Death Pathway can enter by opening the gate of the Underworld.

### Suppression by Higher-Sequence Death Pathway

The RAW states the Death Pathway has a strong suppressive force over existences of a lower Sequence than itself, requiring the opponent to obey almost everything.

- Specific information of the Underworld is described as unknown.
- Underworld undead are described as stronger on average than Spirit World creatures.
- The interior can be regarded as pitch black.

### Escape Limitation

Even Death Pathway Beyonders can enter the Underworld through the gate to avoid danger, but after entering:

- They cannot reappear at the point of entry anytime and anywhere.
- If they encounter danger within, they cannot immediately return to the escaped place at any time.
- Even with Spirit World shuttling at **Sequence 4**, returning to the original place takes time because the shuttle is not as good as the Door Pathway.

**No living being should attempt to set foot in the Underworld.**

### Underworld Honorable Name

- the destination of all death;
- Deep in the hell of the Spirit World;
- Witnesses of all eternity;
- It belongs to the kingdom of death alone.

---

## Astral World

### Description

The **Astral World** (the starry sky in the sense of mysticism) can be regarded as a kind of Spirit World: the form of the Spirit World in the universe.

- Each star is said to represent a god and the corresponding kingdom of God.

The RAW states that specific description in *Lord of Mysteries* is unknown for the time being and may contain errors.

In terms of existence:

- The Astral World can be roughly understood as a kind of Spirit World.
- The Spirit World cannot touch the universe; that is the Astral World.
- High-Sequence Beyonders of the Gate/Door Pathway can carry out “astral shuttle” through the Astral World to travel to other planets.  
  [[LINK LATER: Astral Shuttle | type=mechanic | hint=Gate/Door high-sequence travel via Astral World]]

Era note:

- During the fifth era, gods lived in the Astral World; in the fourth era, they were on land.

At the angel stage of **Sequence 2**, one can go to the Astral World, no longer live on the ground, and become an angel in the sky.

- Angels who walk on the earth are called terrestrial angels.

---

## Land Abandoned by God

### Description

The **Land Abandoned by God** is a continent isolated from reality and sealed away.

- There is no sun; it is dark 24 hours a day.
- Residents judge time not by clocks, but approximately by the number of heartbeats.
- Lightning constantly flashes across the sky; its frequency differs in “day” and “night,” providing reluctant illumination and distinguishing between them.

Its origin is closely related to the history of killing gods at the end of the third era, and everything here is polluted.

The general environment:

- A boundless, long-barren land; even the dust is black.
- Plants that grow are inedible.
- Countless monsters emerge strangely out of thin air in the bottomless darkness.
- Some intelligent structures exist, but are in ruins or inhabited by monsters.

### Human City-States (Timeline-Dependent)

Depending on the specific timeline of the mod:

- There may still be human city-states (e.g., Silver City or Moon City), with Silver City in relatively better condition.
- If the timeline is too late, there may be no human city-states, and it becomes a continent of wandering unknown monsters.
- Even **Sequence 4** demigods are stated to certainly not be able to survive.

> **GM Note:** The RAW frames the existence of city-states as timeline-dependent for a given campaign.

#### Silver City

Residents of Silver City can barely survive:

- Their monotonous food is “black-faced grass.”
- They continue sending exploration teams outside searching for supplies and hope.

Each resident bears a fate:

- Every resident of Silver City can only be killed by their blood relatives; otherwise they become lingering ghosts.
- This is described as the price of Silver City’s “richness.”

#### Moon City

Moon City is described as worse off:

- Its overall strength is not as good as Silver City.
- It is geographically opposite: Silver City is far east; Moon City is far west.
- The two city-states do not know of each other’s existence.
- Moon City’s mission is to guard the boundless high wall of gray fog in the far west of the Land Abandoned by God.

Moon City follows the mission of the ancient Sun God and waits, even though that god can no longer respond here.

- Moon City does not even have “black-faced grass.”
- Without food, they feed on the flesh of tainted monsters.
- The pollution in the meat significantly reduces the mental state of Beyonders and is passed down generation to generation.

Consequences described:

- Newborns are generally deformed (e.g., missing a nose, mispositioned eyes).
- Newborn death rates surpass the sacrifice rate.
- A newborn may lose control even if they become a **Sequence 9** Transcendent.
- Moon City is on the verge of extinction; in about **100–200 years**, residents will gradually die, fade away, and the city-state will be destroyed.

### Additional Characteristics

- Gods other than the True Creator cannot answer prayers here (not including the Fool).  
  [[LINK LATER: True Creator | type=other | hint=god with authority here]]  
  [[LINK LATER: The Fool | type=other | hint=exception noted by RAW]]
  - The reason given: the place is completely isolated; the True Creator has authority to open entrance/exit and is sealed here.

- Saints of the Aurora Society (**Sequence 4–3**) can enter and leave at will with the help of the True Creator, and may bring other believers in to hide.  
  [[LINK LATER: Aurora Society | type=faction | hint=saints Sequence 4–3 can enter/leave]]
  - This is given as one reason the Aurora Society cannot be completely wiped out despite terrorist actions.

- The Spirit World exists but cannot be used:
  - It is dead silent; travel through the Spirit World is impossible.
  - A minimum of “flash” or divination, passing through walls, and jumping flames is possible.
  - The undead can only wander in reality and usually dissipate soon.

- Darkness without light represents danger:
  - Darkness itself breeds monsters; they are generally ferocious and deformed.
  - If a body enters darkness, weird things may occur (e.g., a person “disappears” and cannot be seen).
  - Monsters can appear out of thin air from any field where darkness appears, even if the darkness lasts only a moment.
  - Simple walls cannot stop them.

- Monsters in the dark can be detected and entangle themselves in places without light.
  - They can be seen in special ways (e.g., spiritual threads).
  - When darkness is illuminated, they may disappear out of thin air—even if you were sure something was there a second ago.

- Chanting a god’s real name can trigger remaining divine power and cause extremely dangerous results:
  - If someone pronounces the real name of the Goddess of the Night, they cannot say it; they open their mouth but the sound disappears out of thin air.
  - The name of the Eternal Blazing Sun causes the person to be killed by holy flame immediately.
  - The name of the Lord of Storms attracts a **Sequence 0** level thunder strike.  
    [[LINK LATER: Eternal Blazing Sun | type=other | hint=real name danger here]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Lord of Storms | type=other | hint=Sequence 0 thunder strike if named here]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Goddess of the Night | type=other | hint=voice disappears if named here]]

- Weird phenomena may occur:
  - Suddenly one more person or one less person while walking.
  - Suddenly reincarnated into a period of time and seeing someone who should not exist here.
  - A boy asking for help who saw a phenomenon that should not exist now.

- The Land/Earth Pathway’s environmental transformation is usually ineffective:
  - Completely polluted, barren land cannot grow plants; “black-faced grass” is an exception.
  - Even demigods from the earth cannot use the soil here.
  - Spiritual materials here are polluted and cannot be used.

- Because of danger, monsters here include many extraordinary existences and thus yield many extraordinary characteristics and spiritual materials.
  - Although generally tainted, they can be used for advancement after purification.
  - Because the total amount of extraordinary characteristics is conserved, many characteristics unavailable outside can be obtained in batches here.
  - Most Beyonder characteristics in the world are kept here.

- Because it was once the land where the ancient Sun God lived:
  - People generally believed in the ancient Sun God, and a small number turned to the True Creator.
  - Residents still perform sacrifice ceremonies to the ancient Sun God to ask for response, though it has been fruitless for thousands of years.

- There are no spiritual materials and potion formulas for the Sun Pathway in the Land Abandoned by God.  
  [[LINK LATER: Sun Pathway | type=pathway | hint=no materials/formulas here]]

### Entrance and Exit

- The entrance is the **Ruins of God War** on the sea in reality.
- After entering, you appear near the **Giant King’s Court**.
- People in reality have a probability of entering by mistake.
- After entering, the only exit is the Giant King’s Court.
- If the “dark angel evil spirit” is still there, it is impossible to leave through the Giant King’s Court before it is eliminated.  
  [[LINK LATER: Giant King's Court | type=location | hint=entry/only exit point]]  
  [[LINK LATER: Ruins of God War | type=location | hint=sea entrance in reality]]  
  [[LINK LATER: dark angel evil spirit | type=other | hint=blocks exit if present]]

---

## East Sunya Sea (Ruins of God War)

### Description

Due to a god-killing operation before the Quaternary Epoch, a large area of ocean east of Loen became the sea area called **The Ruins of the God War**.

This area is extremely dangerous:

- The entire sea area is between illusion and reality.
- You may see phenomena that should not appear or contact creatures that should not appear.
- Residual power from battles of gods can cause sudden, extreme environmental changes.

### Residual Divine Power Zones (Examples)

- The sky may suddenly fall into darkness in a zone:
  - You must go to sleep immediately, or you will disappear in the night.
- A moment that was night may become noon under a scorching sun, or lightning and thunder.
- Plants and life may become unprecedentedly lush and tenacious.

When entering a residual divine power area corresponding to a god, the corresponding extraordinary power may go out of control. Example given (Earth Pathway):

- In an area of flourishing plants and creatures, growing plants can cause watermelons to grow on people’s heads, growing out of control; inside is the person’s brain.
- Corpses may be unable to die, wandering between death and life.
- You may see giants made of corpses, or hands made of corpses rising from the sea to overturn ships.

### Evernight Residual Zone: Shared Dreamland

In the night environment of the Goddess of the Night’s remaining divine power area:

- After sleeping, one enters an unrealistic dreamland.
- The entire ship—or people on nearby islands—enter the dream together.
- If you cannot remain awake in the dream, it resembles being “dreamed by a nightmare”:
  - The person in the dream is said to be the same as under that effect.
  - They usually do not lie and frankly expose their most essential and inner character.

Although it is a dream:

- It cannot be imagined and changed at will.
- A mythical temple city-state can be seen in the distance.

If you do not enter the dreamland and choose to stay in the dark until you disappear, you usually enter the “hidden town.”  
[[LINK LATER: hidden town | type=location | hint=entered by refusing dream in Evernight residual darkness]]

> **GM Note:** For more specific situations, the RAW cites “Chapter 165 ‘Sea of Ruins’” in Volume 3 *Traveler* through “Chapter 183 Spiritual Body,” and for hidden town details, “Chapter 100 Town” through “Chapter 113 Return” in Volume 4 *Undead*.

### Additional

- Even on ordinary islands, you can encounter many mid-Sequence extraordinary creatures or “Grahams,” such as a giant stone statue with the ability of a **Sequence 5** guardian.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “Grahams” is referenced without definition/context; may be a translation term or typo.]]

- A proportion of extraordinary creatures here are non-real existences (illusions):
  - They may have mid-Sequence ability.
  - After defeat, they do not yield corresponding extraordinary characteristics.

- Due to lack of exploration, islands may contain treasures from the third era and various relics.
  - Because of residual divine power and the illusion/reality boundary, exploration is usually very dangerous and proportional to opportunity.
  - Beyonders below mid-Sequence should not attempt to explore.

- Even a demigod may encounter an obvious crisis here.
  - Example: a demigod of the Aurora Order was trapped here, showing danger at demigod level.  
    [[LINK LATER: Aurora Order | type=faction | hint=demigod trapped here]]

- The sea area also contains many normal (non-hallucinatory) extraordinary creatures, such as mermaids:
  - They are almost impossible to find outside, but can be found here.
  - They are described as “one of the ceremonies” for a **Sequence 6** Faceless Man of the Fool Pathway to advance to **Sequence 5** Puppet Master.
  - The Church of Evernight also breeds mermaids, but they will not be used by wild Beyonders; official Beyonders need to accumulate meritorious service for promotion.  
    [[LINK LATER: Fool Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Faceless Man to Puppet Master advancement ceremony]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Church of Evernight | type=faction | hint=breeds mermaids]]

- There is a hidden intersection leading to the Land Abandoned by God, but depending on timeline, reaching it often means you can never return.

- Suggested minimum exploration capability:
  - At least Pirate General (**Sequence 5**) level strength.
  - A reliable fleet, or a reliable ship at Pirate General level.
  - Corresponding sailors and supplies.

- If you plan to reach demigod level here:
  - Even if you become a demigod, before **Sequence 3** or **Sequence 2** your strength is not enough.
  - At least one entire team needs to be brought.
  - Because divine power can go out of control, even demigods face the danger of death.

---

## Abyss

### Description

The **Abyss** is described as a place where even demons can no longer survive, formed by the sinking of an entire continent in old days.

It is strongly polluted. Its owner, the demon king Fabuti, located inside the Abyss, has fallen into a situation of being polluted by the outer god “Mother Tree of Desire.”

- It is a forbidden place for all living beings.
- It is a realm where even demons cannot survive.

Rumors:

- The entrance is located in the Misty Sea.
- Emperor Roselle used the Black Emperor of the Fourth Epoch to explore the Abyss.

Even the demigod-level Black Emperor suffered erosion after entering for a period of time.

- During long exploration, no living creatures were found; even demons were only corpses.

The RAW describes it as:

- the source of all evil,
- the place of corruption,
- the dwelling place of demons,
- the most polluting place,
- where even angels will lose control,
- where those who guard it will eventually be assimilated,
- a dark side of the universe where gods can also be corrupted, independent of the real world.

Even foreign demons will not try to go here, because most demons cannot survive here.

**Even if you have enough strength, do not explore rashly.**

- The Abyss itself was blocked in the second era.
- To enter now, you must cross the sea of mist in the west.

[[LINK LATER: Fabuti | type=other | hint=demon king, owner of Abyss]]  
[[LINK LATER: Mother Tree of Desire | type=other | hint=outer god polluting Fabuti/Abyss]]  
[[LINK LATER: Misty Sea | type=location | hint=rumored entrance region]]  
[[LINK LATER: Emperor Roselle | type=other | hint=explored Abyss]]  
[[LINK LATER: Black Emperor | type=other | hint=Fourth Epoch demigod-level explorer]]

---

## Collective Subconscious Sea

### Description

The Psychological Alchemist model: imagine a person’s subconscious as an island in the sea.

- Each island is actually the peak of a mountain on the seabed.
- The vast majority of the “mountain” is hidden under the sea level.

Using this scene, the Psychological Alchemist summarizes the **collective subconscious sea**:

- If everyone’s consciousness is an island:
  - The exposed peak above sea level is surface consciousness.
  - The enormous part below sea level—extending down toward the abyss—is the subconscious mind.

In the world’s occult sense, these islands are described as real:

- The collective subconscious sea is an infinite sea formed by countless “islands of consciousness.”

Because everyone’s islands are hidden in the same ocean:

- The shared ocean connects all islands.
- Islands of consciousness can affect each other through this connection, like daily interpersonal communication.

If you are a Beyonder of the Spectator Pathway and enter your own island of consciousness, you can also:

- descend via your island into the seabed,
- then reach other people’s islands through the common sea that belongs to collective consciousness.  
  [[LINK LATER: Spectator Pathway | type=pathway | hint=enter consciousness islands/collective sea]]

### Nature of the “Sea” and Connection to the Spirit World

Although called a sea, it is formed based on human imagination and is not a real sea.

- You will not suffocate.
- There are no fish.
- It changes somewhat based on different people’s imagination.

It is also closely related to the Spirit World:

- After entering the “ocean” through an island, you can see the same seven auroras in the top sky that represent the Seven Lights of the Spirit World.

### High-Sequence Spectator Capabilities (As Described)

At high Sequence of the Spectator Pathway, a Beyonder can:

- directly enter other people’s consciousness islands in daily life,
- see their thoughts and dreams,
- attempt to find weaknesses in the subconscious mind and discover secrets,
- plant psychological hints day and night by entering others’ islands,
- indirectly affect personality, character, and planning,
- silently change a person over time without evidence to others, making them live and develop according to the Beyonder’s will.

The RAW states this subtle influence can be done even without reaching high Sequence (but takes longer).

### Additional

#### Ways to Enter Your Own Island

Several methods are described; the easiest is entering a dream state:

- nightmare,
- meditation,
- psychological suggestion,

This works for:

- other people’s dreams,
- your own dreams,

as long as you can stay awake in the dream.

#### What an “Island” Looks Like

The “island of consciousness” is usually a miniature world.

- It is only intuitively suitable to be called an “island” when Spectator demigods start battles and can look down over the whole island at will.
- Entering via dreams, you may not see a shoreline; instead you see the entire dream’s content as a miniature world.
- The carrier that carries the dream—the dream owner’s consciousness—is called an island.

#### Limits on Controlling Another’s Dream

After entering other people’s dreams:

- Unless you have Nightmare Domain abilities, or can control dreams to some extent through Spectator psychological guidance, you cannot do whatever you want.
- You are the guest; the host consciousness dominates the dream.
- Even with psychological guidance or Nightmare Domain power, the dream master has first priority in controlling the dream.

Example:

- If a nightmare drags you into a dream, you are still dreaming.
- If you realize you are dreaming, you can summon the sun and directly melt/annihilate the dream.

#### Descending to the Subconscious (“Stairs”)

In your dreams, you can create scenes/items by imagination.

To enter the collective subconscious sea through your own island:

- go to the edge of the dream (the “edge of the island”),
- instead of an ocean you see bottomless pure darkness,
- manifest stairs and descend step by step into your subconscious.

In this descent you will see:

- your past,
- what you do not want to face,
- psychological barriers you do not want to accept.

The descent is described as long and brings loneliness and torture; you may reach the “bottom of the sea” after so long you forget how much time has passed, arriving at a scene similar to the middle of the Spirit World.

If you do not have Spectator-domain or psychotherapy abilities, there is a high chance of losing control due to subliminal scenarios during this process.

#### High-Sequence Spectators Bypassing the Descent

High-Sequence Spectators usually do not need the stair process:

- They can consciously walk in the collective subconscious sea directly.
- At **Sequence 3**, they can not only send consciousness in, but can also send their physical body in and “live there.”
  - Example given: a **Sequence 3** mental dragon did this.

#### Danger of Exploration

Exploring the collective subconscious sea is very dangerous:

- You may encounter products of consciousness from many representatives:
  - some happy, some cheerful,
  - most with uncontrollable gloom and darkness (due to the compulsion of the times).
- Psychic dragons may wander here.
- Before demigod stage, consider exploration appropriately.
- Specific scenes can refer directly to the Spirit World (as per RAW).

#### Demigod-Level “Island” Conflict and Mental Warfare

At high Sequence, extraordinary battles are deeply involved with islands of consciousness:

- Spectator Pathway demigods can often enter nearby islands simultaneously while operating normally in reality.
- They can guide out cognitive weaknesses in communication and break through consciousness defenses to dig secrets from the subconscious.
- Demigods not in the Spectator realm are usually unaware.

In addition to social battles, the Spectator can:

- set off a psychic storm,
- plant seeds of spiritual plague in an island,
- set hypnosis and psychological hints to manipulate a target in their island.

Because Spectators can view the entire island:

- they can discover marionettes and parasites at a glance.
  - The former have “dead” islands of consciousness.
  - The latter have abnormal overlaps.
  - This premise is stated as requiring a Spectator Pathway demigod.

Even a “secret puppet” has an island of consciousness:

- As long as something is conscious, it produces an island.
- Even if essentially dead, plague seeds may not affect the puppet itself but can spread plague through it to other people.
- For the owner of the secret puppet, plague seeds can spread along “spirit body lines.”

The RAW frames Spectator demigod combat as an offensive and defensive battle of the soul:

- They can control the thinking of countless people at the beginning, subtly making thousands follow their ideas.
- Slightly depraved performances can directly make others slaves.
- This may lead toward loss of control, because inappropriate performances gradually lead you toward the abyss of loss of control.

#### “Everything That Speaks Must Be Known”

At a higher level of the Spectator Pathway:

- You do not need to visit an island of consciousness.
- You can gain insight into thoughts by relying on movement in the collective subconscious sea.
- Every word spoken subtly impacts the collective subconscious sea; the Spectator Pathway can search through that subtle influence (described as a “big data search”).
- This is distinguished from the “insights” of the Reader Pathway.

#### Sequence 0: Global Psychological Hints

Spectator **Sequence 0** can:

- give psychological hints to the entire ocean of consciousness,
- affect all islands above the ocean,
- pass the influence down generation to generation.

The RAW presents this as part of why dreamers can “follow what they say”:

- Everyone in the world unknowingly follows the psychological suggestion.
- Daily life makes the world’s thoughts and feelings gradually move toward the announced result.

It is framed as equivalent to giving an order to everyone:

- everyone unknowingly contributes to carrying out that order together.

Only Spectator pathways or angels with similar abilities can counter this to some extent.

- Because Beyonders (including angels) cannot completely break away from the collective subconscious sea, even angels cannot completely resist these influences.
