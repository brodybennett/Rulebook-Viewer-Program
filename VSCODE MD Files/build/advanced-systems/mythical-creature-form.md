# Manifesting Mythical Creature Forms

## Becoming a Mythical Creature

An **Extraordinary** becomes a mythical creature if any of the following occurs:

- The Extraordinary is killed above **Sequence** 4. [[UNCLEAR: “above Sequence 4” could mean higher-ranked Sequences or numerically greater Sequence values.]]
- Their sanity is cleared. [[UNCLEAR: “sanity is cleared” is not defined here (e.g., reduced to 0, reset, or otherwise removed).]]
- The promotion ceremony fails. [[LINK LATER: Promotion Ceremony | type=rule | hint=advancement procedure]]
- They use the ability to manifest the form of a mythical creature.

## Witnessing a Mythical Creature Form

Witnessing a mythic creature’s form requires an immediate **Sanity Check (SC)**. [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=mechanic | hint=mental stability score and checks]]

### Witnessing Restrictions

- People below the demigod level cannot spy on any mythical creature form.
- Demigods (**Sequence** 4–3) cannot spy on a complete mythical creature form belonging to an angel (**Sequence** 2–1).
- All such witnessing carries the corresponding Sanity Checks and risk of loss of control.

## Example Mythical Creature Manifestations by Pathway

> **Lore:** The following “Way/Pathway” examples describe what the manifested mythical creature form looks like and what it can do at specific Sequences.

### Way of the Fool

You become countless embracing spirit worms with patterns that drive people crazy.

- **Attribute gain:** Restore HP to maximum value; constitution +10; inspiration +10.

#### Sequence 4

- **Effect:** The spirit worm begins to frantically manipulate the spirit threads of all surrounding enemies.
- **Effect (on witness):** A creature witnessing the Fool immediately loses all actions and can only take free actions, **or** it takes two rounds to take an action. [[UNCLEAR: The condition that determines which of the two outcomes applies is not stated.]]
- **Aftereffects/Consequences:** In the next round, these creatures become marionettes.

#### Sequence 3

- **Effect:** The Insect of Spirit can summon the most terrifying historical scene in memory.
- **Effect (terrain):** The terrain becomes inhospitable to any human beings and may be filled with lava, tsunamis, etc.
- **Effect (damage):** Creatures take 3d6 points of damage each round they remain in the area.

#### Sequence 2

- **Effect:** Wish at will.
- **Effect:** The spirit worms wish on each other, producing even scarier, twisted effects. [[UNCLEAR: The mechanical limits and outcomes of “wish at will” are not defined.]]

#### Sequence 1

- **Effect:** Twisted.
- **Use:** You can use a +10 combat twist to twist a creature or object you touch.
- **Effect:** The target enters some sort of looping state. [[UNCLEAR: “combat twist” and “looping state” are not defined here.]]

### Apprenticeship Pathway

You become countless gates made of star worms; peering through the gates reveals the endless void.

- **Attribute gain:** Restore HP to maximum value; constitution +10; inspiration +10.

#### Sequence 4

- **Effect:** You have opened door after door.
- **Limits:** Once per turn.
- **Use:** As a swift action, you can teleport a creature or spell, with a single attack, to any location you choose. [[UNCLEAR: What qualifies as “a single attack” for teleporting a creature or spell is not defined.]]

#### Sequence 3

- **Effect:** Now, you are connected to the starry sky.
- **Limits:** Once per turn.
- **Use:** As a swift action, you can summon a fearsome creature.
- **Creature stats (usually):** 40 hit points; three attacks per turn; each attack deals 3d6 damage; AC 25.

#### Sequence 2

- **Effect:** Planeswalker.
- **Limits:** Once per turn.
- **Use:** As a swift action, you can duplicate a supernatural effect your opponent uses.

#### Sequence 1

- **Effect:** Random Teleportation.
- **Effect:** You can move the stars and move the planets freely according to your wishes; you are the key to the stars. [[UNCLEAR: No mechanical procedure is provided for “Random Teleportation.”]]

### Error Way

You become a clock made of time worms; every tick seems to make people insane.

- **Attribute gain:** Restore HP to maximum value; constitution +10; inspiration +10.

#### Sequence 4

- **Effect:** You entered any living being.
- **Limits:** Once per turn.
- **Use:** As a free action, you can spawn a worm of time into any living creature.
- **Special cases:** Special methods must be used to find and destroy the worm of time. [[LINK LATER: Worm of Time | type=term | hint=implanted time-worm effect]]

#### Sequence 3

- **Effect:** Now, you cheat the laws of nature.
- **Limits:** Once per turn.
- **Use:** As a free action, you can change the natural environment once.
- **Special cases:** You can make time into day or night; steal the sun or free it to destroy any supernatural barriers. [[UNCLEAR: “steal/free the sun” and barrier destruction have no defined mechanics here.]]

#### Sequence 2

- **Effect:** Trojan Horse.
- **Limits:** Once per turn.
- **Use:** As a free action, you can steal an opponent’s fate.
- **Aftereffects/Consequences:** Creatures whose destiny has been stolen will not be recognized by anyone, and it will be difficult to relate to other things. [[LINK LATER: Fate | type=term | hint=destiny/fate mechanic]]

#### Sequence 1

- **Effect:** Error.
- **Limits:** Each turn.
- **Effect:** You can add an affix to an item that is the opposite of its original affix, and it immediately takes effect on every level and sense. [[UNCLEAR: “affix,” “opposite,” and the scope of “every level and sense” are not defined here.]]
- **Example:** A man who is turned into a woman is, in reality and on every level, both a woman and a man.

## Temporary Mythical Creature Form Rules

> **GM Note:** These rules are presented as “more complicated morphological rules” because the original author’s rules are not perfect and some mythical creature forms are not yet provided.

### Demigod vs. Angel Forms

- At the beginning of demigod (**Sequence** 4–3), you can show an **Incomplete Mythical Creature Form**.
  - Unless you have special means at the demigod stage, opening the mythical form is equivalent to a desperate fight:
    - You immediately suffer your own Sequence-level Sanity Check (as if advancing), and you may go out of control.
- As an angel (**Sequence** 2–1), you can assume the **Complete Mythical Creature Form**, all as a free action.
- If you are instantly killed and you die, you die without taking on the form of a mythic creature.

### Core Stat Changes on Taking Mythical Creature Form

- **Effect:** Immediately multiply your base health and base spirituality by 2 times.
- **Effect (restoration):** Your current health and spirituality are restored based on the increased upper limits.
  - Example (from RAW): If your life limit is 60 and you currently have 10 points, when the upper limit becomes 120, your life recovers to 70 points.
- **Special cases (incomplete form):** In an incomplete mythical creature form, the owner can deliberately display runes with distorted and chaotic lines on the body surface.
  - **Effect (witnessing/appraisal scope):** The scope is the sanity loss of promotion at the same level as yours, and the same value is given here again. [[UNCLEAR: The procedure for this “scope” and how it applies to witnesses is not fully specified.]]

### Sanity Loss: Witnessing Forms and Advancing

Witness mythical creature forms / out-of-control forms at different Sequence levels, and Sanity loss when advancing:

| Sequence | Sanity loss |
|---:|:---|
| 9 | 0/1 |
| 8 | 0/1d3 |
| 7 | 0/1d3 |
| 6 | 1/1d6 |
| 5 | 1/1d6 |
| 4 | 1d6/1d10 |
| 3 | 1d6/1d10 |
| 2 and above | 1d10/1d20 |

- **Limits:** Witnessing a mythic form (or a sanity attack from a runaway) can only trigger once per encounter, unless someone holds the witness’s head down to keep looking at the mythic pattern.

### Clones, Secret Puppets, and Sanity Checks

- A sanity appraisal that is one personality different from the witnessed person can take effect on the main body even through a clone like a secret puppet; the same is true for the mythical form.
- Even through the secret puppet, as long as the owner of the secret puppet witnesses your mythical form, they are subject to sanity appraisal.
- **Exception:** If it is an independent clone made like a wrongly made clone, the audience’s personality separation will not affect the main body. [[UNCLEAR: This paragraph relies on undefined terms (e.g., “one personality different,” “secret puppet,” “wrongly made clone,” “audience’s personality separation”) and an unclear causal chain.]]
[[LINK LATER: Secret Puppet | type=term | hint=clone/puppet body]]
[[LINK LATER: Clone | type=term | hint=duplicate body mechanics]]

### Sanity Attack Bonus by Sequence

**Sanity Attack Bonus**: When making a corresponding promotion check or a Sanity Check when facing a mythical form, the 1d20 sanity check should be increased by the following value.

- The Sequence number for the bonus is based on the person who casts the sanity attack, not the person who suffers it.
- After adding the bonus, if the final result exceeds current Sanity, the Sanity test fails; otherwise it succeeds.

Example (from RAW):
- A promotion check has Sanity loss 1/1d6. The character rolls 1d20 against current Sanity 14.
  - If 1d20 > 14: failure; deduct 1d6 Sanity.
  - If 1d20 ≤ 14: success; deduct 1 Sanity.
- Because this is a sanity check of **Sequence** 6, add the corresponding bonus:
  - Final check is 1d20+6 against existing Sanity.

Bonuses:

| Sequence | Bonus |
|---:|---:|
| 9 | +3 |
| 8 | +4 |
| 7 | +5 |
| 6 | +6 |
| 5 | +7 |
| 4 | +8 |
| 3 | +9 |
| 2 and above | +10 |

(Use the above bonus on Sanity checks only when advancing to use mythic creature form.)

### Sanity Test Procedure

- **Check/Test:** Roll 1d20 + corresponding sanity attack bonus.
- **Effect (failure):** If the total is greater than your current Sanity, the test fails.
- **Effect (success):** If the total is less than your current Sanity, the test succeeds.

Example (from RAW):
- For 1d3/1d6, A has 16 Sanity. rd20 rolls 1, so A succeeds.
- A rolls 1d3 to determine sanity loss and deducts that value from 16.
  - If a 3 is rolled, Sanity becomes 13.

- **Special cases:** There is no big success in the sanity test, only a big failure.
- **Special cases:** A value of 20 is only considered a big failure in the sanity test, and the sanity damage is directly taken to full. [[UNCLEAR: “sanity damage is directly taken to full” could mean maximum possible loss for that event or reducing Sanity to 0; the intended resolution is not stated.]]

### Unofficial Rule: Persona +1 While in Mythical Form

All mythical creature forms share the following rule:

- **Effect:** Your persona is temporarily treated as +1.
  - For skills obtained in **Sequence** 4 and strengthened in **Sequence** 3: if you open mythical creature form at the **Sequence** 4 stage, you do not gain new **Sequence** 3 abilities, but the existing **Sequence** 4 abilities that can be enhanced will reach the character of **Sequence** 3. [[UNCLEAR: “reach the character of Sequence 3” is not defined; it appears to indicate using the improved/strengthened version.]]
- This is not a true personality change:
  - A **Sequence** 3 Extraordinary opening mythical creature form does not become equal to a **Sequence** 2 angel.
  - A **Sequence** 2 angel still suppresses them, and this does not change personality suppression.

- **Special cases (penalties):** This increase in divinity affects penalties similar to when a thief steals abilities.
  - Example (from RAW): If a thief tries to steal a **Sequence** 4 extraordinary ability, the identification penalty faced by the thief will be **Sequence** 3 instead of **Sequence** 4.

[[LINK LATER: Persona | type=term | hint=power rank/personality metric]]
[[LINK LATER: Divinity | type=term | hint=divine nature/power scaling]]
[[LINK LATER: Ability Stealing | type=mechanic | hint=thief-like stealing rules]]
[[LINK LATER: Identification Penalty | type=mechanic | hint=skill/ability identification DC penalty]]

### Combat Action Conversion While in Mythical Form

When you turn on the form of the mythical creature:

- **Effect:** You may choose **one** of the following action types:
  - A spellcasting or attack action, **or**
  - A movement action.
- **Limits:** Before the battle of the mythical creature is over:
  - The chosen action may be used as a free action **once per round**.
  - Actions that take many minutes to achieve can only be replaced by casting/attacking/moving actions.
  - You cannot switch the chosen action during the entire battle.

If you must switch:

- **Cost:** Adjust your mythical form through a full-round action.
- **During this process:**
  - Physical defense cannot get a bonus from agility.
  - You cannot perform any other actions, including a free action.
  - The process does not end until your next turn.

> **GM Note:** The RAW notes that using free actions this way against same-level opponents may leave you a “living target,” and that you may pay a price to cover teammates.

### Usage Frequency, Rest, and Repeated Activations

- **Limits:** Mythical creature form can only be used once every 24 hours.
- **Special cases (rest reduction):** This can be reduced by about 4 hours at most depending on rest situation (the night path comes with a 4-hour reduction).
- **Special cases (insufficient rest):**
  - Not reaching the corresponding rest time does not prevent activation,
  - But you must bear a 1d2/1d5 Sanity check with +5 chance to hit, which can cause you to lose control. [[UNCLEAR: “+5 chance to hit” is not defined in context of a Sanity check; it may mean +5 to the sanity roll.]]

- **Special cases (second activation before full recovery):**
  - Your health/spirituality upper limits still increase as usual,
  - But recovered health and spirituality are only half of the previous one,
  - And you must go through the corresponding 24 hours of rest again.

- **Limits (multiple activations):**
  - In principle, before you get a full 24-hour rest, you can turn on mythical creature form up to three times.
  - The third time, the sanity loss is directly a sanity blow equal to your own mythical form level, and you can enjoy the corresponding hit rate bonus. [[UNCLEAR: “hit rate bonus” is not defined; it may refer to the Sanity Attack Bonus table.]]
  - If you try a fourth activation before resting, you are almost guaranteed to lose control.

### Incomplete Mythical Creature Forms (Demigod Stage)

- **Definition:** **Sequence** 4–3 shows an incomplete mythical form: only part of the whole person is in mythical form.
- **Examples (from RAW):**
  - Darkness **Sequence** 4 can become a huge eight-legged wolf, but the face is still a human face, and a small part of the body still looks human.
  - The viewer channel may become a dragon lady.
  - God of War will become a giant but will not completely lose its previous appearance.
  - The reader will not become a tower of books but a bookshelf.

> **Lore:** An incomplete mythological form is similar to a demihuman: some kind of half-human, half-mythical creature.

### Physique and Size (Volume) Effects in Mythical Form

- **Effect:** Regardless of which mythic form you manifest (complete or incomplete), while you are in mythic form your **Physique +1**.

Humans are usually medium-sized creatures:
- After +1 Physique: they become large-sized creatures.
- Then +1 again: they become super-large-sized creatures.

Some mythic forms list volume separately.

#### Advantages and Disadvantages by Size Difference

If facing enemies two sizes smaller than yourself:
- **Effect:** Damage increases by an additional 1d6.
- **Effect:** The distance of melee attacks is doubled.

If facing enemies two sizes larger than yourself:
- **Effect:** Skill identification +5; skills are easier to hit.

If only one size difference:
- **Effect:** Advantage damage is 1d3.
- **Effect:** Melee attack range is halved.
- **Effect:** Skill identification advantage suffered is only +2.

[[LINK LATER: Physique | type=term | hint=size/strength category and related rules]]
[[LINK LATER: Skill Identification | type=mechanic | hint=hit/identify/accuracy system]]

#### Physique Classes (As Listed)

1. Microscopic organisms (such as bugs and ants)  
2. Small creatures (rats, birds, a hand) small and medium creatures (cats, dogs)  
3. Medium-sized creatures (humans, murlocs, young lions or tigers)  
4. Medium to large size creatures (adult lions, tigers, bears, cattle)  
5. Large-scale creatures (giants, large-scale Extraordinary creatures, Feysacs, God of War Path Extraordinary)  
6. Super-large creatures (the size is comparable to a ship, a 4-meter or 6-meter giant, a creature that can only cause the destruction of a ship)

> **GM Note:** Although enumerated, some volumes are not counted in volume advantages/disadvantages:
> - Tiny and small volumes are collectively counted as small volume creatures.
> - Medium volumes and medium-to-large volumes are collectively counted as medium and large volume creatures.
> - Only large volume and super-large creatures are separated into two separate calculations.
>
> In practice, there are four volumes: small, medium, large, and super-large.

    - Example (from RAW): If you have night potion of **Sequence** 4 and death potion of 5, the mythical creature form of night is prioritized.
  - These contents are explained in detail in subsequent chapters. [[LINK LATER: Subsequent Chapters on Mythical Forms | type=other | hint=rulebook cross-reference]]

### Attribute Conversion Note

All Physique and inspiration added by the above mythical creature form are changed into the corresponding life value and spiritual upper limit during the duration of the mythical creature form. This has absolutely nothing to do with whether you rest before opening the myth.

### Demigod Warning

If you are a demigod who has not yet reached **Sequence** 2 (**Sequence** 4–3):

- Consider your mythical creature form as appropriate, because turning it on likely means you are about to lose control.
- You immediately suffer the sanity strike suffered when the Sequence level is promoted and gain the corresponding sanity strike bonus.
- This can cause immediate loss of control.
- Unless you have angel-level temporary shelter, you should not consider using your semi-mythic creature form unless your life is in danger.

[[LINK LATER: Loss of Control | type=mechanic | hint=runaway/out-of-control rules]]
[[LINK LATER: Angel-Level Temporary Shelter | type=term | hint=protection effect]]

### Special Control Methods (Audience and Fate)

- The Audience Path and the Fate Path can accumulate good luck through hypnosis and psychological suggestion respectively.
- **Effect:** This lets them control mythical creature form for **one minute** at the demigod stage and they will not be subject to sanity appraisal.
  - One minute is the limit.
- Other exceptions may exist; extremely strong willpower and experience can also initially control mythical creature form.

[[LINK LATER: Audience Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Pathway name]]
[[LINK LATER: Fate Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Pathway name]]
[[LINK LATER: Hypnosis | type=mechanic | hint=mental influence]]
[[LINK LATER: Psychological Suggestion | type=mechanic | hint=mental influence]]

### Form Mixing (Transfer Paths) and Belief

- The specific image of the mythical creature form converts according to the strength of current Extraordinary characteristics (explained as considering transfer paths).
  - Example (from RAW): If you are a reader of **Sequence** 5 and switched to the spectator path at **Sequence** 4, your form becomes a hybrid with spectator as main and reader as secondary; **Sequence** 4 suppresses **Sequence** 5.
  - If you later jump back to reader or go to other paths, further mixing is likely.

- Beliefs can change the mythical creature form to a certain extent.
  - Example (from RAW): If you believe in the Evernight Goddess and switch to a Beyonder, the form may still be dominated by a magic wolf.
  - This is decided by the Extraordinary through consultation with the **GM**.

- Repeating the trait increases trait strength; generally the semi-mythical creature form still retains some human appearance depending on the specific situation.
