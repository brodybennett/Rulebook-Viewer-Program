  [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute]]  
  [[LINK LATER: Constitution | type=term | hint=attribute]]  
  [[LINK LATER: Agility | type=term | hint=attribute]]

### Performance Recognition

- Each time you perform a performance that is not repeated and is recognized by different people (especially strangers), choose one of your Performance/Deception skills; it increases by 1 level, up to mastery.  
  [[LINK LATER: Performance | type=term | hint=skill used in spell checks]]

  - Training → Proficiency: 2 times
  - Proficiency → Advanced level: 3 times
  - Advanced level → Proficiency: 4 times  
    [[UNCLEAR: The last tier transition repeats “Proficiency” instead of specifying the next higher level.]]

### Spells

You wield a variety of strange but not powerful spells.

#### Freezing Technique

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**. [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type for spellcasting]]
- **Cost:** Consume 1 **Spirituality Point**. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent to cast spells]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target.
- **Check:** Performance/Deception/Occult vs **Physical Defense**. [[LINK LATER: Occult | type=term | hint=skill used in spell checks]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=term | hint=defense used for spell checks]]
- **Effect:** Rapidly lowers temperature; freezes the surface of the target’s body, dealing **1d6** cold damage.
- **Aftereffects:** Against a target without cold resistance, it suffers a **-2** penalty on its next movement, skill, and ability checks. [[LINK LATER: Cold Resistance | type=mechanic | hint=resistance to cold]]
- **Special:** You can make a glass of water (or something like that) cool down very quickly.

#### Wind Blowing Skill

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**.
- **Cost:** Consume 2 **Spirituality Points**.
- **Effect:** You make the whistling sound of wind suddenly appear, and all light objects are blown away.
- **Benefit selection:** You choose 1 of the following benefits to take effect.  
  [[UNCLEAR: Wind Blowing Skill says “choose 1 of the following benefits,” but only one benefit is listed.]]
  - Choose a wind direction within a range of **10 meters** and gain **6 points of forced movement**, forcing creatures in this range to move **6 meters** in the wind’s direction.  
    [[LINK LATER: Forced Movement | type=mechanic | hint=forced displacement]]
  - For each point of the creature’s size, the forced movement is **-1**, excluding Tiny volume (ants, spider).  
    [[LINK LATER: Size/Volume | type=term | hint=creature size categories used by wind spell]]
- **Volume notes:** Things other than Tiny volume that can rely on “Volume Reduction Wind” are as follows:  
  [[LINK LATER: Volume Reduction Wind | type=term | hint=term used in wind spell size scaling]]
  - Small size (gravel, paper book)
  - Small to medium size (cats, dogs)
  - Medium volume (person)
  - Medium to large creatures (adult tigers, bears)
  - Large creatures (giants, demons, warriors)
  - Creatures of very large size (cyclops, monsters that capsize ships)
  - A total of **6** volumes that can reduce the effects of the wind spell.
- **Special:** Any creature that loses balance will receive double the force of forced movement.  
  [[LINK LATER: Unbalanced | type=condition | hint=lose balance state]]
- **Special:** Among them, once the small volume and small volume are affected by the wind, they will lose their balance by default, and thus the forced movement force will be doubled.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “small volume and small volume” is duplicated and unclear which size categories are intended.]]

#### Fall

- **Use:** 1 spellcasting action. [[LINK LATER: Spellcasting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type; may equal Casting Action]]
- **Cost:** Consume 2 spiritual points. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource; RAW also uses “Spirituality Points” elsewhere]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target on the ground.
- **Check:** Performance/Deception/Occult vs **Physical Defense**; ignores armor. [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=term | hint=defense component ignored by some spells]]
- **Effect:** If the identification is successful, the opponent immediately falls down and loses balance (becomes **Unbalanced**).
- **Condition: Unbalanced**
  - Unable to move, attack, and cast spells.
  - You must use **1 Movement Action** to get out of the unbalanced state. [[LINK LATER: Movement Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type used for movement]]
  - While unbalanced: (Agility and dodge in Physical Defense **-2**).
  - Others gain advantages: (skill and attribute identification) **+2**.  
    [[LINK LATER: Advantage/Disadvantage | type=mechanic | hint=system for modifiers like +2 / -2 and “advantage”]]

#### Flash

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**.
- **Cost:** Consume 1 spiritual point.
- **Targeting and range:** Affects all targets looking directly at you within **10 meters** (centered on you).
- **Check:** Performance/Deception/Occult vs **Physical Defense**; ignores armor.
- **Effect:** Blinds affected targets for **1 round**.
- **Condition: Blind**
  [[LINK LATER: Blind | type=condition | hint=blinded state]]
  - Unless the action targeting other things is an indiscriminate strike, it needs a **Difficulty Value 15** Inspiration test (according to the memory recall direction) to be successfully executed.  
    [[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=mechanic | hint=DV target number]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Indiscriminate Strike | type=mechanic | hint=attack/action that does not require precise targeting]]
  - The detection test is **-8** disadvantageous. [[LINK LATER: Detection | type=term | hint=skill/check type]]
  - “The gain is disadvantageous.”  
    [[UNCLEAR: The phrase “the gain is disadvantageous” is not clearly defined in context of Blind.]]
  - Others have an advantage over it.

#### Fog Creation

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**.
- **Cost:** Consume 2 points of spirituality.
- **Effect:** Create fog covering a range of **10 meters**.
- **Duration:** If the environment is not sealed, the fog dissipates after **1 round**.
- **Fog effects:**
  1) Including you in the fog range, identification of other things as targets is **-4** disadvantageous, excluding indiscriminate strikes.
  2) Looking for something: unless you have prepared in advance, you need to perform a **Difficulty Value 15** detection assessment before performing it (suffering a penalty). In special cases, it may be a listening assessment.  
     [[LINK LATER: Listening | type=term | hint=alternate assessment type mentioned for fog searching]]
  3) Any range ability that can have a substantial impact on the material world (storm of light, wind) will dissipate the fog.  
     [[LINK LATER: Storm of Light | type=other | hint=example area ability that dissipates fog]]
- **Special:** This effect is overridden by blindness, but the check penalty stacks with blindness’ detection penalty.  
  [[LINK LATER: Blindness | type=condition | hint=interaction with fog penalties]]

#### Electric Shock

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**.
- **Cost:** Consume 2 spiritual points.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target.
- **Check:** Perform/Deceive vs **Physical Defense**; ignores agility and evasion in Physical Defense; treats it as light, lightning.
  [[LINK LATER: Evasion | type=term | hint=defense component mentioned by Electric Shock]]
- **Effect:** Deal **1d6** lightning damage.
- **Notes:** Although this counts as lightning, you’re not getting thunder; you’re creating electricity “out of thin air.”
- **Special:** Shock can’t make a vital strike. [[LINK LATER: Vital Strike | type=mechanic | hint=critical hit/vital strike rule]]
- **Special:** If the target is an undead creature, increase the lightning damage by **1d6**.
- **Special:** If the target is wet, you can make another check to paralyze it successfully.  
  [[UNCLEAR: Electric Shock allows “another check” to paralyze a wet target but does not specify what check is used or what it is checked against.]]
- **Condition: Paralyzed**
  [[LINK LATER: Paralyzed | type=condition | hint=paralysis state]]
  - Make a physical examination with a **Difficulty Value 15** to get rid of paralysis; otherwise you cannot perform attack and movement actions.
  - It will not return to normal until the opponent’s next round of actions.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “Opponent’s next round of actions” is unclear about whose turn ends the Paralyzed state.]]

#### Incinerate

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**.
- **Cost:** Consume 2 spiritual points.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target.
- **Check:** Performance/Deception/Occult vs **Physical Defense**.
- **Effect:** Deal **1d6** fire damage.
- **Duration and ongoing damage:** For **3 rounds**, at the beginning of each round, the burned target continues to suffer **1d3** fire damage.

#### Rebound

- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**.
- **Cost:** Consume 1 spiritual point.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 falling or moving target (such as a ball that has just been thrown).
- **Effect:** It returns on the same trajectory, which may cause a surprise effect.
- **Condition: Unprepared**
  [[LINK LATER: Unprepared | type=condition | hint=surprise/unguarded state from rebound]]
  - You are in a hurry, unable to dodge, and lose the agility and dodge in Physical Defense against this attack.

#### Other Tricks

- Other tricks that are logical and allowed by the **GM**; the number depends on the GM’s permission, usually no more than your Inspiration.
- You need to write their effects in advance, unless you are only temporarily using them in daily or usual performances.
- Pay attention to original tricks: tricks should meet the characteristics of being strange but not powerful.

#### Cantrip Skill

- You can cast your spell-like abilities as a quickened cast.
- **Rules:**
  1) Once per round, you can use a **Free Action** to cast any cantrip that requires a casting action. [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type usable once per round here]] [[LINK LATER: Cantrip | type=term | hint=spell-like ability eligible for this rule]]
  2) If you formulate an unexpected way to use a trick before performing it and use it with performance-style techniques (for example, deliberately asking the enemy what will happen next), making the enemy unable to guess what you are going to do by performing and fooling:
     - If you let the trick happen at a moment others can’t imagine—like a performer and audience—then your trick has the effect of being caught off guard. [[LINK LATER: Caught Off Guard | type=condition | hint=effect granted by unexpected timing]]
     - This can be done with special actions such as delayed action, or real inspiration, but you must do the relevant roleplay. [[LINK LATER: Delayed Action | type=mechanic | hint=special action that can enable timing]] [[LINK LATER: Real Inspiration | type=term | hint=term used in cantrip rule]]
- **Special:** Cantrips iden
