# Sequence 7: Astrologer

> **Lore:** Astrologers are defined by strong spiritual intuition, divination interference, and **Astrology**.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main material:** [[LINK LATER: Meteor crystal | type=item | hint=main material]]; [[LINK LATER: blood crystal of Rava octopus | type=item | hint=main material]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute used for appraisals]] +2
- Your [[LINK LATER: Navigating | type=term | hint=skill]] increases by 2 skill levels. [[LINK LATER: skill levels | type=mechanic | hint=proficiency/advanced/erudition/master]]

### Astrology Study and Advancement

- When you receive guidance on astrology-related knowledge that is **non-repetitive**, **effective**, and **true**, and the course lasts **at least 2 hours**, your **Astrology** increases by **1 level**.
  - This increase **cannot exceed** the skill level of your instructor or books.
- You can only learn **once per day** to digest knowledge.
- From **proficiency to advanced level**, and from **advanced level to proficiency**, you need to learn **2** and **3** times respectively. [[UNCLEAR: “advanced level to proficiency” appears reversed, but the RAW text is mechanically specific.]]
- To further improve the skill, you must obtain a book or Extraordinary guidance where the skill itself has reached a higher level.
  - It takes **4** and **5** times to reach **erudition** and **master** respectively.

### Astrology

You use **Astrology** for [[LINK LATER: divination | type=mechanic | hint=information-gathering via appraisals]] or to interfere with divination and [[LINK LATER: spiritual intuition | type=mechanic | hint=perception mechanic]].

- **Use:** 1 [[LINK LATER: spell-casting action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Cost:** 2 points of [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource spent to use abilities]]

This ability can be used in the following ways:

1. **Horoscope / Appraisal**
   - You ask your own spirituality to perform a horoscope, conduct an [[LINK LATER: Inspiration appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=test using Inspiration]], and get feedback based on the results.
   - **Special (advanced crystal ball):** If you use an [[LINK LATER: advanced crystal ball | type=item | hint=divination focus]], (purchase consumes **3 levels of reputation**, proficiency consumes **1 level**, and knowledge does not consume), the skill identification of Astrology changes from **Inspiration** to **Inspiration + Astrology identification**. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW mixes “purchase/proficiency/knowledge” with “reputation” in a way that does not clearly state when each cost applies.]]
     - The [[LINK LATER: Astrology identification | type=mechanic | hint=skill component]] of [[LINK LATER: ordinary crystal balls | type=item | hint=divination focus]] is limited to **proficiency**.

   - **Divination outcomes by Difficulty Value**
     - **Difficulty Value 15:** Get a very general result (e.g., finding objects will only tell you a city).
     - **Difficulty Value 20:** Get a more general result, usually giving a general direction.
     - **Difficulty Value 25:** Obtain a fairly accurate result; object-finding is accurate to a certain street.
     - **Difficulty Value 30:** Obtain a very accurate result; divination reveals a specific content.
     - **Identification failure:** Repeating the divination only gets the same result; you need new clues to divine again.
     - **Great success:** Results are extremely accurate; content is specific, and time, place, and people are revealed.
     - **Big failure:** Based on the final value of the appraisal, you still obtain the corresponding content, but attract the attention of related beings. If the content did not involve hidden beings, then the directly or indirectly related Extraordinary notices being watched.
       - Becoming aware of the gaze requires a spiritual intuition test.
       - The existence of higher than **1 person** is detected by default regardless of the Difficulty Value. [[UNCLEAR: “higher than 1 person” is not defined (level/Sequence/other).]]
     - **Special:** Before obtaining new clues, repeated divination in the same direction only gets the same result, regardless of Difficulty Value.

   - **Other divination factors**
     1. Divination of things involving other people fails by default if there is no clue, and succeeds by default if there is their blood or belongings.
     2. For each clue obtained, divination related events gain a **+2 beneficial** modifier, but divination of targets higher than **1 character** fails by default. [[UNCLEAR: “higher than 1 character” is not defined (Sequence/level/other).]]
     3. The reason for detection and failure of the higher level is that under special circumstances, it is possible for the lower level to divine for the higher level. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW references “higher level” without specifying the governing rule or threshold.]]
     4. Whenever you are in a deep sleep, you can conduct an Inspiration appraisal with **Difficulty Value 20**. If it succeeds, and something directly related to you has happened in the current period, you see a general picture that needs to be interpreted. This is the first step of [[LINK LATER: dream interpretation | type=mechanic | hint=interpreting dream visions]].

     > **GM Note:** Example given in RAW: if you are related to the god in charge of the moon, you will see a red moon; blood represents misfortune; tombstones represent the direct implication of certain events.

   - **Astrology optional divination methods**
     - In contrast to a fortuneteller, an astrologer only needs a crystal ball or asks their own spirituality to get the following comprehensive perspective:
       - The location of objects and people.
       - The risk of a thing, and the extent of the risk.
       - Whether 1 person is another person; confirm whether a piece of information is correct.
       - Divining the development of an event based on fate, or the development of a person's fate itself (also requires sufficient information).
     - Other possible divination angles: Astrology cannot perform tarot divination, pendulum divination, etc.
     - **Special:** Astrology usually cannot see the picture, only the corresponding star map for the astrologer to interpret. Therefore, if you divine the position of an object, you do not get the corresponding picture; you judge the location through the star map.

2. **Interfere with divination and intuition**
   - You interfere with divination, spiritual intuition, [[LINK LATER: danger intuition | type=mechanic | hint=hazard-sensing]], [[LINK LATER: prophecy | type=mechanic | hint=foresight]], etc.
   - There are two ways to interfere with these:
     1. **Smash a high-level crystal ball**
        - Smash 1 high-level crystal ball.
        - Choose 1 specific mystic information related to you (e.g., you plan to attack someone next).
        - Realize anti-divination: conduct **Inspiration + Astrology identification** as the Difficulty Value of anti-divination. [[LINK LATER: anti-divination | type=mechanic | hint=excludes info from divination]]
        - If an ordinary crystal ball is smashed, proficiency in Astrology is limited.
        - Carrying limits (considering other items):
          - Ordinary clothes: up to **2** crystal balls
          - Performance-style tuxedo: up to **4**
          - Mage robes: up to **8**
     2. **Rely purely on spirituality**
        - Purely rely on spirituality (do not smash anything).
        - The identification of anti-divination Difficulty Value changes from Astrology to **Inspiration**. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW alternates between using Astrology vs Inspiration to set/identify anti-divination Difficulty Value, and does not clearly define which applies when.]]

   - **On success:** This information is excluded in related divination, spiritual intuition, and prophecy, unless it exceeds the corresponding Difficulty Value.

### Premonition of Danger

Also known as intuitive premonition: you can predict the actions of others at critical moments and perceive danger.

- **Trigger:** Whenever you are raided, sneak attacked, or there is something on the scene that is about to put the raid or sneak attack into action.
- **Additional trigger:** If 1 damage exceeds half of your maximum health (rounded up), this ability can also be triggered.

When triggered:

1. Perform a **Difficulty Value 15** Inspiration appraisal.
   - **On success:** An idea flashes in your mind immediately, telling you the dangerous form.
   - After you succeed, you will not be able to be raided or ambushed.
   - Threats that you mistakenly think are “safe” will not trigger the ability.
2. Under the above premise, as long as you are not restrained or affected by other reasons, your [[LINK LATER: physical defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]] gains a **+4 temporary bonus**.
   - In the face of [[LINK LATER: firearms | type=term | hint=weapon category]], [[LINK LATER: light | type=term | hint=damage type?]], and [[LINK LATER: lightning | type=term | hint=damage type?]], you retain [[LINK LATER: agility | type=term | hint=attribute]] and [[LINK LATER: dodge | type=mechanic | hint=evasion mechanic]] in physical defense instead of gaining the +4 bonus.
3. If the danger range is large enough (e.g., a gas explosion in the entire area in an instant), even if you are alarmed by the danger, you will not be able to gain benefits.

- **Special:**
  - Dangers higher than **1 level** cannot be foreseen.
  - Hazards dependent on luck are foreseeable but gain no benefit.
- Danger premonition is a kind of spiritual intuition, so it is invalidated by anti-divination and [[LINK LATER: anti-prophecy | type=mechanic | hint=blocks prophecy]].

- **Sequence 6:**
  - Your Inspiration appraisal is successful by default.
  - The flashing thought changes to flashing the picture, so as to know the manifestation of danger.
- **Sequence 5:**
  - You can perceive danger higher than **1 personality**. [[UNCLEAR: “personality” is not defined and may be a mistranslation, but the RAW text is mechanically specific.]]
