# Sequence 6: Biologist

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +2, Dexterity +1, Inspiration +1
- [[LINK LATER: Biology (skill) | type=term | hint=skill that increases by 1 level here]] increased by 1 level.

### Rapid Growth Research

- Your Biology has been included in the rapid growth category of [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9 rapid growth category | type=mechanic | hint=the “rapid growth category” referenced here]].
- Biology can be upgraded to [[LINK LATER: Erudition | type=term | hint=skill rank/cap]] at most, and [[LINK LATER: Botany (skill) | type=term | hint=skill that can also be upgraded to Erudition]] can also be upgraded to Erudition.
- Every time you complete a complete research without repeating the type, it is regarded as a growth.

### Biological Hybridization

- **Biological Hybridization:** You can hybridize various organisms to produce strange products, and the limit can hybridize bacteria. [[UNCLEAR: The phrase “the limit can hybridize bacteria” is ambiguous (minimum scale vs. restriction to bacteria).]]

Biological Hybridization is not a short-term ability. Like scientific research, it must go through multiple stages such as theory, practice, and error correction. Through this ability, you can permanently transform a certain entry of one creature into another creature.

- **Creature definition:** A “creature” includes intelligent creatures, plants, and animals; you can cross any type of them.

#### Transformation Procedure

To use Biological Hybridization, complete all stages below to finish one transformation:

1) **Confirm the modified creature**
   - Choose:
     - A creature you mainly transform, and
     - A creature whose entry is the “transferred” sample.
   - Example: If you want to eat apples instead of medicine, prepare apples and medicinal materials, and transfer the “cough” entry to apples.
   - Sample requirement: Some samples must represent the corresponding entries. For example, when transferring internal organs of creatures, the samples must be internal organs rather than blood.

2) **Theoretical stage**
   - After obtaining samples of the two creatures, you need **1d2 weeks** to confirm the theoretical direction of transformation.
   - If you have enough realistic inspiration, then as long as you have summarized the general content of the theory in reality, you can skip this step. [[UNCLEAR: No criterion is given for what counts as “enough” inspiration to skip the theoretical stage.]]

3) **Experiment phase**
   - You need **1d3 months** to carry out the experiment and conduct a biological identification with **Difficulty Value** 25.
   - If the identification fails, there is a problem with the experiment; you must conduct another **1d3 months** of experiments until the identification is successful.
   - **Special:**
     - You must have **2 hours** for experiments every **24 hours**.
     - For every additional hour, the experimental identification will be **+1 beneficial**.
     - You must persevere to obtain the benefits.
     - That is, you can’t get benefits if you study more than **1 hour** on a certain day.
     - You must study **1 more every day. Hour** [[UNCLEAR: The “Special” rules about extra hours and daily study are self-contradictory/grammatically unclear, but are reproduced faithfully.]]

4) **Analysis stage**
   - You need **1d3 months** to analyze experimental data and compare it with your theory to adjust the direction of the next experiment.
   - This **1d3 months** also includes the time for the second experiment, but there is no need to conduct the identification again. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear what “the second experiment” refers to and what identification is being waived.]]

5) **Achievement stage**
   - The creature you mainly transform gets the transferred entry and becomes a special hybrid species.

#### Notes

- There is no upper limit to the number of times a creature can be transformed, but some effects may require multiple transformations to achieve.
- Example: To turn fish blood into wine, you need to combine the fish with some plant sugar entries, then combine microorganisms that convert sugar into wine with another fish, then combine the two fish to achieve the result.
- Your transformation base must be a creature.

> **GM Note:** When creating a Biologist who has not just been promoted, the **GM** can allow them to enter play with modifications equal to the attribute of Inspiration, because a modification needs to be researched several times to be considered complete, so the number of times each modification has been modified will not be counted.

#### Hybrid Extraordinary Creatures

- If Biologists transfer the entry of a certain [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary creature | type=term | hint=source species with extraordinary properties]] / Extraordinary to another species, they need to obtain samples of the corresponding entry of the Extraordinary.
  - Example: If they want to transfer the cell proliferation of the [[LINK LATER: Rose Bishop | type=other | hint=extraordinary entity cited as an example]], they must obtain the flesh and blood of the Rose Bishop.
- This is considered to have passed on the Rose Bishop’s flesh and blood growth entry.
- The species after transformation is not regarded as Extraordinary items / [[LINK LATER: spiritual materials | type=term | hint=crafting/material category referenced here]], and has become an independent species that does not contain [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary characteristics | type=term | hint=core trait that the new species explicitly does not contain]], but has corresponding properties.
- Whether the entry to be transferred is an extraordinary creature or a normal transformation, the content must be specific and cannot be broad.
  - Example: You can transfer the cell proliferation of the Rose Bishop, but you cannot transfer the entry of the Rose Bishop Sequence 6 (representing all abilities).
- After being transferred, the new species inherits the special type represented by the transferred entry (for example, a mushroom inheriting the Rose Bishop’s cell proliferation ability).
  - Even if it does not have Extraordinary characteristics, it is still regarded as a [[LINK LATER: fallen creature | type=condition | hint=classification applied to the new species]] and belongs to [[LINK LATER: evil | type=term | hint=alignment/classification referenced here]].

> **GM Note:** Because failure of the experiment can face serious consequences, organisms that fail the experiment may die or leave serious sequelae.

### Highly Toxic

Your hair can be highly toxic.

- **Cost:** 3 [[LINK LATER: spiritual points | type=term | hint=resource spent to use Highly Toxic]]
- **Use:** 1 attack action. Tear off a handful of your hair, designate one effect below, then throw it at the target.
- **Targeting and range:** The throw resists physical defense.
- **Effect:** Deals **2d6** poison damage, and the designated effect takes effect.

#### Effects

1) **Severe Itching**
   - Every time a new round starts, the target must immediately make a Will Test (Difficulty Value **20**), otherwise it is forced to use a swift action to scratch the skin, causing **1d3** physical damage to itself.

2) **Shortness of Breath**
   - The target’s breath begins to weaken, the eyes lose focus, and the skills and attribute appraisals continue to suffer **-2 disadvantages**.

3) **Laughing Wildly**
   - The target can’t hold back laughter and can’t breathe.
   - Attacking / casting / full-round actions require a Will Test (Difficulty Value **10**) to execute successfully.

4) **Vomiting**
   - Every time a new round starts, the target must make a Constitution appraisal (Difficulty Value **20**), otherwise it starts vomiting and loses **1d6 HP**.

5) **Cough**
   - Every time a new round starts, the target must make a Will Test (Difficulty Value **15**), otherwise it coughs violently and loses **1** attack/casting action, or **2** swift actions.

#### Detoxification

- **Use:** Use 1 casting action to perform any [[LINK LATER: Medicine (skill) | type=term | hint=check used for detoxification]] (Difficulty Value **20**) within **2 rounds**, or take a potion that can detoxify.
- **Effect:** The effect will continue after this time, until you get **1 hour** or extraordinary medicine Rescue. [[UNCLEAR: The duration/endpoint for detoxification is unclear (“until you get 1 hour or extraordinary medicine Rescue”).]]
- **Special:** Biological effects of more than **1** character are effective for only **1 round**, even without medical assistance, and effects of more than **2** characters have no effect. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear what “effects of more than 1/2 character(s)” means (stacking, multiple sources, or multiple targets).]]
