# Sequence 7: Psychologist

## Psychologist

> **Lore:** Known as a “psychoanalyst” in ancient times. Their physical fitness is strengthened, and they can directly affect targets.

- **Ability List:** Shock and Awe (Dragon Power), Frenzy, Mental Suggestion, Soothe (Comfort), Mind Reading
- **Main Materials:** Mirror Dragon Eyes (pair), Elder Tree Fruit

[[UNCLEAR: The line about “skill growth of Sequence 9” is referenced but not defined in this section, so its exact meaning cannot be confirmed.]]

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:** Mirror Dragon Eyes ×2, Elder Tree Fruit ×1

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +1, Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1
- Psychology / Psychological Guidance can quickly learn to “Erudition.”
  [[UNCLEAR: “Erudition” is not defined here; it is unclear whether this is a rank, proficiency tier, or a specific feature name.]]

### Passive Traits

- **Enhanced Smell:** You can distinguish subtler smells to better grasp real thoughts. In **Mind-Reader State**, your passive bonus increases to +6.
- **Darkvision:** You can clearly see items hidden in the dark.
- **Careful Speech:** You cannot accidentally reveal something. Every word you say has been carefully considered. If a similar situation occurs, the **GM** can remind you and allow you to withdraw the corresponding content—unless you do so on purpose.
  - **Special:** This is not absolute. If some means bypass your mental activities (such as hypnosis), you can still be forced to reveal information.

### Shock and Awe (Dragon Power)

Also known as “group chaos.” You make enemies panic as if facing a dragon.

- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality**
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target, or an area within 10 meters.
- **Effect:** The effect succeeds by default.
  - When you use this ability, your pupils lighten, become light-gold, and (if they become vertical) the following effects last for 1 round:
    1. **Ordinary people** with **Willpower** 2–3: gain **Fear** and **Awe**; immediately run wildly to get away from the source of fear.
    2. **Ordinary people** with Willpower 4: gain **Fear** and **Awe**; immediately flee to get away from the source of fear.
       > **GM Note:** “Above-average” targets in the Willpower 2–4 category may be frightened into incontinence.
    3. **Ordinary people** with Willpower 6, or **Beyonders** with increased Inspiration or Willpower: gain **Fear** and **Awe**; they may resist the forced movement from Fear. If the resistance succeeds, they can only spin in place and cannot move. See [[LINK LATER: Special Status | type=rule | hint=Movement restrictions referenced here]].
    4. **Beyonders** of Sequence 7, or Willpower 6+: gain **Shock** and **Fear**; resistance to forced movement is successful by default. They stand still trembling and spinning in place, but still cannot truly perform a moving action.
- **Limits / Special:**
  - When affecting more than 1 character, Will defense against the targets can only be effective with a [[LINK LATER: Psychology Check | type=mechanic | hint=Check required for multi-target Will defense]].
- **Repeated Use (Dragon Might):** If Dragon Might is used continuously, the effect is downgraded:
  - Result ① becomes ②
  - Result ② becomes ③
  - Result ④ “only lasts for 3 rounds, and then 1 round”
  - The level dropped equals the number of consecutive uses.
  [[UNCLEAR: The exact timing of the “3 rounds, then 1 round” duration change for result ④ is not fully specified.]]

### Frenzy

Detonates the target’s emotional or mental state, causing them to fall into “frenzy.”

- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality**
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within your field of vision.
- **Effect:**
  - The target must be in at least one madness symptom or emotional state (excluding **Stunned** and “indeterminate madness itself”).
  - The target suffers 1/1d3 **Sanity** loss for each corresponding state, and the detonated emotional state is immediately cleared.
  [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear how to interpret “1/1d3 Sanity loss” (which value applies, and under what condition).]]
- **Manifestation (non-mechanical):** When you cast it, your pupils lighten, become light-gold, and may become vertical.

### Mental Suggestion

You suggest the target through specific actions, language, and media.

- **Cost:** 1 point of **Spirituality** per use
- **Use:** 1 spell-casting action
- **Method (choose one):**
  - **Action:** 1 **Free Action**. Your eyes reflect a light-golden color; you can plant psychological hints on witnesses. You may also use candles, a finger, and similar actions to draw focus to a specific object.
  - **Language:** Speak a discourse containing the psychological hint; you must specify a target (or choose your own discourse).
- **Effect:** To apply a suggestion, you must tell the **GM** the plain text of the hint content. The suggestion may achieve the following effects (as approved by the GM):
  1. **Keep in good condition:** Set a time period or trigger condition. When met, for 5 minutes the target gains a +2 beneficial bonus to skill and attribute appraisals, and a beneficial -2 to Sanity loss.
  2. **Stay awake:** Set a time period or trigger condition. When the target enters a dream, they realize they are in a dream.
  3. **Answer questions:** Set a time period or trigger condition. For 5 minutes, the target strongly wants to answer questions and may lie.
  4. **Follow the promise:** This can be your hint, or it can directly affect a promise made by the target. Breaking the promise requires a [[LINK LATER: Will Test | type=mechanic]]. The **Difficulty Value** is your “Inspiration + Charisma + Psychological Guidance bonus.”
     - “It cannot be done within 3 hours Repeat identification.”
     [[UNCLEAR: The phrase about “Repeat identification” is unclear; it may refer to retry limits, but the exact restriction is not stated cleanly.]]
  5. **Complete a certain action:** Set a time period or trigger condition, and select a certain identification in that period. This identification gains a +1 beneficial bonus, and this mental suggestion can be stacked.
  6. **Contain emotions:** Set a time period or trigger condition; use “Inspiration + Charisma + Psychological Guidance” as the Difficulty Value.
     - **Actively generated emotions:** Each time a related emotion appears, use Inspiration to identify against the Difficulty Value; if the identification fails, it is not generated.
     - **Emotions caused by the outside world:** The emotion’s source uses the corresponding ability identification—or an Inspiration identification—against this Difficulty Value.
  7. **Perform a certain behavior:** This can be long-term or short-term. The effect is equivalent to “Follow the promise,” such as going to a certain church at a certain time every day.
  8. Other more allowable and reasonable psychological hints set by the GM; refer to the above effects.
- **Special suggestive situations:**
  1. **Target is not voluntary:** Use 1 Psychological Guidance to resist the [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=Defense referenced in suggestion rules]] to succeed, and gain bonuses/penalties equivalent to [[LINK LATER: Thinking Simulation | type=mechanic | hint=Referenced but not defined here]].
     [[UNCLEAR: “Thinking simulation” is referenced but not defined in this section, so its exact modifiers cannot be confirmed.]]
  2. **Suggestion involves life / the most important thing:** The mental suggestion is immediately dismissed by default and has no effect.
  3. **Suggestion in combat/chaos area:** The suggestion fails by default and cannot be executed successfully.
  4. **Suggestion not triggered:** A suggestion lasts for a maximum of 1 month.
  5. **Multiple hints:** A creature can receive at most a number of hints equal to (their Inspiration attribute value ÷ 2) at the same time.
  6. **Content aligns with the target’s willingness:** If it is reasonable enough, gentle enough, and is something the target would have done, the GM can let the Player follow cues by letting the Player see only relevant information.
  7. **Implied content limit:** The implied content must be concise and not complicated; the reference standard should not exceed 20 characters.

### Soothe (Comfort)

Helps Beyonders on the verge of losing control regain sanity and escape danger.

- **Cost:** 2 points of **Spirituality**
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within 10 meters.
- **Effect (choose/apply as appropriate):**
  1. Clear a creature’s emotional/crazy symptoms. The target gains 1 point of temporary Sanity for 1 hour; it cannot be stacked. It reappears later.
     > **GM Note:** Soothe can only temporarily suppress mental illness. A real solution requires [[LINK LATER: Psychological Guidance | type=term | hint=Psychological treatment process]]; use guidance to gradually adjust the target’s mentality/viewpoint so things develop in a better direction. The GM decides whether the disease is truly cured.
  2. Whenever there is a Beyonder beside you whose Sanity returns to 0, as long as you still have the action of casting spells, you are allowed to try to soothe them.
- **Let a Beyonder about to lose control regain sanity:**
  - Make 1 Mental Guidance appraisal. Initial Difficulty Value is 40; for each sequence level you have, the Difficulty Value is -5.
    [[UNCLEAR: “For each sequence level you have” is ambiguous (counting method not defined here).]]
  - Each time the target is larger than you by 1 character, the identification Difficulty Value is +15. If greater than 2 characters, “big success” is ignored.
    [[UNCLEAR: “Larger by 1 character” and the meaning of ignoring “big success” are not defined in this section.]]
  - There is only one chance. If the identification fails, the target is completely out of control.

### Mind Reading

You place the target in a semi-hypnotic state through candlelight, pure dew, and other media, and communicate directly with their mental body.

- **Setup / Use:**
  - Prepare the environment with media such as candles/hydrosols.
  - 1 **Free Action**: tint your pupils gold.
  - Choose a target who is looking at the candle (or smelling the pure dew) in front of you and is looking at you. The target usually must be voluntary; they enter a trance.
- **Trance State:**
  - A target in **Trance State** answers all your questions truthfully and cannot lie.
  - This has no effect on a target who can [[LINK LATER: Stay Awake in Dream | type=mechanic | hint=Exception referenced in Mind Reading]].
  - If a question is vague and too broad, then if it is answered, it means the other party has the willingness to inform.
    [[UNCLEAR: The last sentence does not specify how vagueness changes what can be learned, only a narrative interpretation.]]
