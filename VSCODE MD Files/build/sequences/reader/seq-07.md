# Sequence 7: Keeper of the Knowledge

## Keeper of the Knowledge

> **Lore:** Also known as “Detective.” A profession emphasizing knowledge mastery and reasoning, supported by solid combat training and equipment use, and capable of reconstructing events through extraordinary means.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Effect:**
  - **Attributes** [[LINK LATER: Attributes | type=rule | hint=Core Rules]]: Strength +1, Constitution +2, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
  - **Skills** [[LINK LATER: Skills | type=rule | hint=Skill list and ranks]] (each +1 level): Detection, Disguise, Tracking, Climbing, Jumping, Swimming, Throwing, Fighting (including subdivisions), Shooting (including subdivisions), Gunnery, Explosion.
  - The skills listed above are in your **Rapid Growth Category** [[LINK LATER: Rapid Growth Category | type=mechanic | hint=Skill advancement tier]] and may be upgraded up to **Mastery** [[LINK LATER: Mastery | type=mechanic | hint=Skill rank]].
  - **Potion Skill** [[LINK LATER: Potion Skill | type=mechanic]] (see [[LINK LATER: Sequence 8 | type=sequence | hint=Potion skill reference]]): **Erudition** [[LINK LATER: Erudition | type=term]].

### Fighting Skills

> **Lore:** Your training balances offense and defense, making it difficult to be overwhelmed in a fight.

- **Effect:**
  - Your Fighting (including subdivisions) deals **+1d6** damage of the same type as the attack’s normal damage.
  - You gain **+2 Favorable** [[LINK LATER: Favorable | type=mechanic | hint=Benefit modifier]] to Throwing, Shooting (including subdivisions), Gunnery, and “blasting identification.”
  - You gain **+2 Favorable** to the following special actions: Critical Strike, Two Combo, Approximate Shooting. [[LINK LATER: Critical Strike | type=mechanic | hint=Special action]] [[LINK LATER: Two Combo | type=mechanic | hint=Special action]] [[LINK LATER: Approximate Shooting | type=mechanic | hint=Special action]]
    - This bonus does **not** apply to First Aid or Surprise Attack. [[LINK LATER: First Aid | type=mechanic | hint=Special action]] [[LINK LATER: Surprise Attack | type=mechanic | hint=Special action]]
    - It also does **not** increase special actions that “simply gain benefits” (examples: Gain Momentum, Aiming) from +2 to +4; only “Impact identification” is affected. [[LINK LATER: Gain Momentum | type=mechanic | hint=Special action]] [[LINK LATER: Aiming | type=mechanic | hint=Special action]] [[LINK LATER: Impact Identification | type=mechanic | hint=Special action or check]]
- **Limits:**
  - This is a potion effect; it cannot be stolen or recorded. [[LINK LATER: Stolen or Recorded | type=rule | hint=Copying/recording limits]]

[[UNCLEAR: The terms “blasting identification” and “Impact identification” are unclear (possible mistranslations or specific named checks).]]
[[UNCLEAR: The stacking rule about actions that “gain benefits” (e.g., Gain Momentum, Aiming) is unclear; the text says they do not go from +2 to +4 except for “Impact identification,” but the exact interaction is ambiguous.]]

### On-site Restoration

- **Cost:** 2 points of **Spirituality** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=Resource points]].
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action** [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=Action type]].
- **Targeting and range:** An area up to 100 meters centered on you.
- **Effect:** You immediately learn information that helps analyze and restore events that occurred in the area, including:
  - Which sacred, dark, corrupt, and undead forces appeared in the area within the last 3 days; you can identify their specific types and approximate strength, roughly corresponding to several **Sequence** levels. [[LINK LATER: Sacred/Dark/Corrupt/Undead Forces | type=term | hint=Force categories]] [[LINK LATER: Sequence | type=rule | hint=Sequence system]]
  - What weapon a corpse died from, or what type of extraordinary ability caused the death (example: flames). [[LINK LATER: Damage Types | type=rule | hint=Core Rules]]
  - If an Extraordinary battle occurred: how many Extraordinary people were involved, as long as none of them hid themselves while taking action. [[LINK LATER: Concealment | type=mechanic | hint=Hiding oneself during action]]
  - Other extraordinary abilities that affected the environment (examples: physical damage, cold damage, lightning damage), including their specific types and approximate strength, roughly corresponding to several **Sequence** levels. [[LINK LATER: Environmental Effects | type=mechanic | hint=What counts as affecting the environment]]
  - Whether the area has been moved, had concealment attempts, been vandalized, dismantled, or otherwise appears unnatural.
  - Other information that fits the categories above (the core of this ability is to provide clues).
- **Limits:**
  - Effects that do not affect the environment are not included (examples: paper doll substitutes and mental blows). [[LINK LATER: Paper Doll Substitute | type=mechanic | hint=Example of non-environmental effect]] [[LINK LATER: Mental Blow | type=mechanic | hint=Example of non-environmental effect]]

> **GM Note:** This ability is primarily for generating investigative clues, not for delivering complete answers.

### Ritual Mastery

- **Effect:**
  - When you perform **Ritual Magic** [[LINK LATER: Ritual Magic | type=rule | hint=Core ritual system]], you may pray not only to the gods you believe in; if conditions are right, you may also cause other righteous gods to respond to you in the same way. [[LINK LATER: Righteous Gods | type=term | hint=Which gods qualify]]
- **Essence:**
  - This response comes from extraordinary mastery of the preferences and rituals associated with this path: you know how to please gods enough to gain a response even without being a believer.
  - Example (God of Knowledge and Wisdom): [[LINK LATER: God of Knowledge and Wisdom | type=faction | hint=Deity]]
    - Corresponding celestial body: the blue star. [[LINK LATER: Blue Star | type=term | hint=Ritual correspondence]]
    - Materials: mercury, brass, lavender, pepper, mint. [[LINK LATER: Ritual Materials | type=item | hint=Material components]]
    - Timing: Saturday, 11:00 to 12:00. [[LINK LATER: Ritual Timing | type=mechanic | hint=Time correspondences]]
- **Limits:**
  - This cannot be stolen or recorded because it is knowledge. [[LINK LATER: Stolen or Recorded | type=rule | hint=Copying/recording limits]]
