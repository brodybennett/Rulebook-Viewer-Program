## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Completely calculate your current past and future, thoroughly understand all the causes of your past, and enumerate all the possibilities you will experience in the future. *(Unofficial ceremony.)*
- **Function:** Rely on the experience of omniscience and rationality to resist the scouring of knowledge, turning your own career into an anchor point. If you want to spy on the fate of others, you must first explain your own fate.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +2; **Education** +2; all your skills increase by 1 level.

### All-Seeing Eye

You can manifest the brass-colored all-seeing eye to examine a target’s past and future.

- **Cost:** 1 free action to open or close, unconditionally.  
  [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=Action economy]]
- **Use:** When opened, your pupils become brass eyes. If you are not human, the all-seeing eyes can also materialize from your body out of thin air.
- **Effect:** While active, you are in the **All-Seeing Eye State** and gain the benefits below.

#### All-Seeing Eye State Benefits

1) **Past sight (no identification required):** You spy on the past information of a target you choose within visible range.  
   - This ignores anti-divination and anti-prophecy effects, and even Personality.  
     [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=Rules for identifying targets/effects]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Anti-Divination | type=condition | hint=Protections against divination]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Anti-Prophecy | type=condition | hint=Protections against prophecy]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Personality | type=term | hint=Power tier/level term used by rules]]
   - Things higher than your Personality can be spied on, but there is no guarantee you will not be counterattacked or polluted.  
     [[LINK LATER: Counterattack | type=mechanic | hint=Divination backlash]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Pollution | type=condition | hint=Corruption/mental contamination]]
   [[UNCLEAR: “Ignores Personality” but also references “things higher than your Personality”; the threshold/interaction is not clearly defined.]]

   > **GM Note:** A timely counterattack causes you to only know what is preventing the prying, and only information directly related to that thing will be counterattacked. (Example: Klein’s fate and identity can be spied on, but it is blocked when it involves source quality.)  
   > [[LINK LATER: Source Quality | type=term | hint=Setting/cosmology concept]]

2) **Future sight (no identification required):** On the basis of the above, you can also choose the target’s future information.

3) **Official spying (once per round):** Officially starting to spy on information is a free action once in a round. Each round, choose **one** of the following information categories about the target you chose.  
   - You can only choose to spy on the past or future separately once.  
   [[UNCLEAR: The “past or future separately once” restriction is ambiguous about whether both can be taken in the same round or only one total per round.]]

   **Choose one category:**
   - All existences that intersect with the target’s destiny, including all the previous identities of the target, belong to a kind of attachment.  
     [[LINK LATER: Destiny | type=term | hint=Related to Fate rules]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Attachment | type=term | hint=Destiny intersections]]
   - The target’s Pathway: whether the Pathway has been changed, the original Pathway, and its Sequence level, Personality, items held and still held, the Pathway and name of each item.

     [[LINK LATER: Sequence Level | type=term | hint=Advancement tier]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Items | type=item | hint=Held and previously held]]
   - The target’s current **blood volume**, **spirituality**, **sanity**, and **three defenses**.  
     [[LINK LATER: Blood Volume | type=term | hint=HP/health equivalent]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=Resource/stat]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term | hint=Mental stability stat]]  
     [[LINK LATER: Three Defenses | type=term | hint=Defense categories]]
   - More specified snooping content: generally select a broad category rather than individual information; you can also select individual information.

- **Special:** If you have spied any information on a target, you will continue to gain an advantage over them, even if the ability is turned off.  
  [[LINK LATER: Advantage | type=mechanic | hint=Rules meaning of “advantage”]]

#### Repeated Snooping (More Detail)

The content that has already been spied can be spied again. Repeated snooping yields more detailed information:

- **Fate/Destiny-related:** You learn what they have experienced layer by layer (some information may be hidden).
- **Pathway-related:** Includes items they have held. You can understand how they became an Extraordinary, how to promote, where to get the main material, specific item information, the repeated potion they took, etc.

  [[LINK LATER: Main Material | type=item | hint=Primary ritual/potion materials]]  
  [[LINK LATER: Potion | type=item | hint=Advancement consumable]]
- **Blood volume / spirituality / sanity-related:** Known layer by layer:
  - First: the upper limit of attributes instead of current data.
  - Then: the values of 6 attributes.
  - Then: all skills and levels mastered.
  - Finally: you are allowed to directly view the corresponding character card.
