# Sequence 5: Mystic Instructor

## Mystic Instructor

As a **Mystic Instructor**, you master varied mystical techniques that can help delay an [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary | type=term]]’s **Loss of Control** [[LINK LATER: Loss of Control | type=mechanic | hint=core instability mechanic]].

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

> **Lore:** This “unofficial ceremony” is meant to prevent the promotion process from collapsing your understanding into self-destructive chaos.

- **When used:** Before [[LINK LATER: Promotion | type=mechanic | hint=Sequence advancement]] to this Sequence.
- **Ritual (unofficial):**
  - Disrupt all extraordinary knowledge you have mastered so you cannot understand its principles/components, and you lose your grasp of it.
  - Restrict your “unstoppable thinking” ability.
  - Keep subconscious observation and interpretation to a minimum.
- **Why this matters (at the moment of promotion):**
  - Your extraordinary knowledge begins to “go berserk.”
  - The extraordinary abilities you have mastered (and can simulate) combine uncontrollably and randomly into strange, chaotic secret arts.
  - This distorts the knowledge and cognition you have understood, leading toward Loss of Control. For a [[LINK LATER: Reader Pathway | type=pathway]] Beyonder, a collapse of cognition is described as fatal, and the distorted secrets also cause extreme damage.
- **Intended stabilization method:**
  - By limiting thinking and disrupting what you can understand *before* promotion, the promotion’s uncontrolled observation/inference reorganizes the disrupted knowledge, and you neutralize the rampant thinking through practice.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute]] +2.
- **Growth:** All skills mentioned by your [[LINK LATER: Potion | type=term | hint=skills granted by potions]] can be quickly grown to mastery.

### Mystery Mastery

You master magical, diverse, unique, and rare **Mysteries** [[LINK LATER: Mystery | type=mechanic | hint=personalized secret technique]].

- **Definition:** A *Mystery* is essentially an improvement of an [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Ability | type=mechanic | hint=core ability]]—turning it into something that is truly your own rather than a simulated ability.
- **Dependency:** Which secret techniques you can use depends on your extraordinary knowledge.
- **Ongoing development:** A qualified Mystic Instructor should frequently develop their own secret techniques.
- **Special:**
  - If you have analyzed 1 [[LINK LATER: Demigod | type=term | hint=demigod-level ability]] ability or above, the secret technique you can make can only meet your level, otherwise the effect will still be halved.
  - [[UNCLEAR: The “Special” clause is self-contradictory/ambiguous about when effects are halved and what “meet your level” restricts.]]

#### Example Secret Techniques

If you analyze a technique’s “prototype,” it can be used even if the corresponding knowledge does not meet the conditions.

- **Apprentice knowledge reaches [[LINK LATER: Erudition | type=term | hint=knowledge rank]] and above:**
  - **Hidden Words**
    - **Use:** 1 free action.
    - **Cost:** 1 [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term | hint=sanity points]] point per sentence.
    - **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within line of sight.
    - **Effect:** Your words are intelligible only to that target.
  - **Teleportation**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Effect:** Perform 1 [[LINK LATER: Spirit World Shuttle | type=mechanic | hint=Spirit World travel]] to a designated place. After you arrive at the corresponding position in the [[LINK LATER: Spirit World | type=location]], you can see the scene corresponding to your location in reality before you exit the Spirit World.
  - **Signal**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Cost:** 2 [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=term | hint=resource]].
    - **Effect:** Choose an area no longer than 100 meters, and decide an entrance to enter the area (such as a window or a secret passage). If someone does not enter in this way, your spirituality will warn you that the area has been broken into.
    - **Limits:** The number of areas selected by Signal cannot exceed your Inspiration.
  - **Sealing Technique**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Cost:** 2 Spirituality Points per minute.
    - **Duration/Maintenance:** Maintenance requires continuous payment of casting actions.
    - **Targeting:** Choose a target or yourself.
    - **Effect:**
      - Keep the target in the current state.
      - If the target is on the verge of Loss of Control, the situation will not continue to deteriorate.
      - If the target is in a normal state, they are not affected by other extraordinary abilities’ positive or negative effects (excluding mental abilities).
    - **Limits:** The sealed target can still suffer damage, suffer Sanity or other attacks from outside, and therefore lose control or die.

- **Artisan knowledge reaches Erudition and above:**
  - **Archaeology**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Cost:** 2 Spirituality Points.
    - **Effect:** Choose an object; you reveal the age since it was made.
  - **Pathfinding**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Cost:** 2 Spirituality Points.
    - **Effect:** Whether indoors or outdoors, you reveal a route from here to an exit or other territory.

- **Combat knowledge reaches Erudition and above:**
  - **Golden Armor**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Cost:** 2 Spirituality Points and gold in at least 1 room.
    - **Effect:** Gain 10 points of extra health and 6 points of armor, and gain 5 points of damage reduction. When the extra life is all destroyed, the armor’s effect disappears.

- **Sun knowledge reaches Erudition and above:**
  - **Blessing**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Cost:** 2 Spirituality Points.
    - **Targeting:** Specify a weapon or medium.
    - **Effect:** Its next attack adds 1d6 [[LINK LATER: Holy Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] (effective only once).
  - **Purge**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Cost:** 2 Spirituality Points.
    - **Effect:** Clear a target of [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=condition | hint=curse effects]], [[LINK LATER: Toxin | type=condition | hint=poison/toxin effects]], and [[LINK LATER: Fear | type=condition | hint=fearful conditions]] up to 1 character higher than you.
    - [[UNCLEAR: “Up to 1 character higher than you” is unclear (level/Sequence/other scaling).]]

- **Earth knowledge reaches Erudition and above:**
  - **Healing**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Cost:** 3 Spirituality Points.
    - **Effect:** Choose a target; restore 2d6 hit points.
  - **Spiritual Stitching**
    - **Use:** 1 casting action.
    - **Cost:** 2 Spirituality Points.
    - **Effect:** End a target’s [[LINK LATER: Madness | type=condition]].

- **Other knowledge reaching Erudition and above: Self-developed techniques**
  - After becoming a Mystic Instructor, other Erudition+ knowledge is expressed through secret techniques you develop yourself.
  - Generally, the number of suitable self-created secret techniques equals your Inspiration; you can also develop more than this number.
  - A suitable occult technique generally needs to be “weird but effective,” reasonable, and approved by your **GM**.
  - Your secret art knowledge should reach Erudition and generally cannot involve demigod abilities.
  - It is not necessary to copy corresponding Pathway abilities; you may diverge and create according to the nature of the Pathway.

### Mystic Ritual

You channel occult power into [[LINK LATER: Ritual Magic | type=mechanic | hint=ritual casting]].

- **Concept:** A secret art ritual can be treated as a further improvement on a conventional secret technique.
- **Requirement:** It still requires praying to a god to perform it.
- **Claimed advantages:** In effective range and other aspects, the ritual’s effect may be better than the original ability and can “break through common sense.”

#### Example Secret Rituals

- **Knowledge of the Night has reached Erudition and above: Roselto’s Dream Technique** [[LINK LATER: Roselto's Dream Technique | type=ritual]]
  - **Process:** 5 minutes of ritual magic.
  - **Cost:** 8 Spirituality Points.
  - **Prayer:** [[LINK LATER: Goddess of the Night | type=other | hint=deity]].
  1. If you have the dreamer’s belongings (flesh, hair, etc.), you can almost ignore distance and enter the dream of the item’s owner from far away.
  2. This can only enter other people’s dreams; you cannot actively make others enter your dreams. It lasts up to 5 minutes.

- **Reader Path rituals usable directly: Spirit Seance Ceremony** [[LINK LATER: Spirit Seance Ceremony | type=ritual | hint=Reader Path]]
  - **Process:** 5 minutes of ritual magic.
  - **Cost:** 8 Spirituality Points.
  - **Prayer:** [[LINK LATER: God of Knowledge and Wisdom | type=other | hint=deity]].
  1. The host must include “I beg you to let me communicate with xxx” in the prayer mantra; this requires a complete real name or a code name with a mysterious point.
  2. The owner of the real name will feel the prayer and can project their spirit onto the body of the ceremony performer.
  3. The owner of the real name can choose to occupy the hand or mouth of the person performing the ceremony; communicate by having one person write and one person speak.
  4. In this way, it is also possible to communicate remotely with a person next to the ceremony performer.
  5. Distance limit for demigods in this ceremony: 926 kilometers (500 nautical miles).

- More secret art rituals that match “weird but effective” are within the scope of allowing originality. It is recommended that original rituals and ordinary secret arts occupy the same “column.”
