# Arbitrator Pathway: Sequence 9

## Arbitrator

> **Lore:** Represents order and rules, corresponding to the Tarot card “Judgment.”  
> **Lore:** Possesses convincing charisma and sufficient authority, as well as excellent fighting ability to deal with the unexpected.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Dexterity +1, Inspiration +1.
- Your [[LINK LATER: Fighting (skill) | type=term | hint=core combat skill, includes subdivisions]] skills rise by 1 level.

### Reputation Growth

- Whenever you arbitrate a non-repetitive, challenging dispute and uphold justice, your **Reputation** [[LINK LATER: Reputation | type=term | hint=skill used for reputation appraisals and authority]] skill goes up by 1 level.
- Such increased Reputation:
  - Will not provide you with assets.
  - Will only increase your personal authority.
  - Can (at most) quickly increase to mastery. [[LINK LATER: Skill ranks | type=mechanic | hint=training/proficient/advanced/mastery]]
- **Limit:** This improvement is limited to 1 time per day, so as to leave enough time for your reputation to start spreading.
- From training → proficient → advanced → proficient, you need to preside over justice 2, 3, and 4 times respectively.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The final step repeats “proficient”; the intended skill-rank progression is uncertain.]]
- Creating a character that isn't just promoted can boost growth skills with twice the potion's Inspiration. [[LINK LATER: Potion | type=item | hint=advancement consumable]]  
  [[UNCLEAR: “growth skills” and “twice the potion’s Inspiration” are not defined here and could be interpreted multiple ways.]]

### Arbitrating Authority

- **Effect:**
  1. Your Reputation and **Charisma**-related identification is favorable +2. This does not affect your assets and appearance, but your personality charm. [[LINK LATER: Charisma | type=term | hint=social attribute/trait]]
  2. When performing any [[LINK LATER: Social skill appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=any social skill check/appraisal]] , you can replace the corresponding skill with a Reputation appraisal, replace social interaction with your charm and authority, and communicate based on your personality charm and authority to make people convincing.
  3. In the event of conflict, you can shout “Stop!”, and your Reputation will fight against all [[LINK LATER: Will defense | type=term | hint=defensive stat used against Reputation in this ability]] defenses to stop the conflict.
- **Limits:**
  - The effect does not include the target that has been determined to be hostile. [[LINK LATER: Hostile (status) | type=condition | hint=target already determined hostile]]
  - It can temporarily calm the creatures affected by emotions and stop the creatures whose desires are detonated. [[LINK LATER: Desire detonation | type=condition | hint=desires “detonated” state referenced here]]
  - Desire explosions are not included, and the emotional state will not be cleared. [[LINK LATER: Desire explosion | type=condition | hint=excluded from this effect]]
  - This ability cannot be stolen or recorded. [[LINK LATER: Stolen/Recorded abilities | type=mechanic | hint=copy/record interaction rules]]

### Fighting Skills

- **Effect:**
  1. Your Fighting (including subdivision) increases the damage by 1d6, and the damage type is the same as the original damage.
  2. In addition to [[LINK LATER: Credit | type=term | hint=advancement/skill-improvement resource referenced elsewhere]] , your Fighting (including subdivision) skills can also be quickly improved. The limit and number of upgrades are the same as your Reputation, but the condition for improvement is changed to accept at least 2 hours of real, non-repeated effective guidance, and the maximum reaches proficient. [[LINK LATER: Proficient | type=term | hint=skill rank]]
  3. It is beneficial +2 to [[LINK LATER: Special action appraisals | type=mechanic | hint=checks for special actions like critical strike/two combo/close shooting]] such as critical strike / two combo / close shooting, excluding first aid / surprise attack, and does not affect special actions that simply gain benefits. For example, gaining momentum and aiming will not change from +2 to +4. Only affects identification.
  4. You gain [[LINK LATER: Fast dodge | type=mechanic | hint=dodge feature referenced here]] , retain full physical defense against [[LINK LATER: Firearms | type=term | hint=weapon category]] (excluding light/lightning), and gain 1 extra level of dodge. [[LINK LATER: Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=dodge level mechanic]]
- **Scaling:**
  - [[LINK LATER: Sequence 7 | type=sequence | hint=Arbitrator Pathway Sequence 7]] and [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=Arbitrator Pathway Sequence 5]]: Your extra evasion increases by 1 level. [[LINK LATER: Evasion | type=mechanic | hint=extra evasion level referenced here]]
- **Limits:**
  - This is the effect brought by the potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.

### Verdict

- **Cost:** 1 **casting action** [[LINK LATER: Casting action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]; consume 3 **spirituality points** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality points | type=term | hint=resource spent to activate abilities]].
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target who has committed a crime within the [[LINK LATER: Field of vision | type=mechanic | hint=line-of-sight/vision rules]].
- **Use:**
  - Say the keyword “judgment,” then say the content of your judgment (for example, “My verdict is, leave it!”).
  - Use the Reputation test to counter its [[LINK LATER: Will test | type=mechanic | hint=Will-based opposing test]].
- **Effect:**
  1. If the test is successful, the opponent must fulfill the content.
  2. The content of the ruling specified by you should be closely related to the crime committed (for example, you cannot make the target kill itself for stealing).
  3. As long as your verdict is executed by the target, the target’s corresponding crime will be cleared in [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=term | hint=mysticism rules for crimes/labels]]. It can be understood that a criminal is labeled as a crime. After the corresponding crime is cleared, you can no longer judge the same crime on that target.
- **Modifiers:**
  - For each 1 Sequence the target is higher than you: -2 disadvantage to the Reputation check of the Judgment ability.
  - Every time the target is higher than you by 1 character: -2 disadvantage in the Reputation appraisal, the judgment will only take effect for 1 round, and it will be invalid if it is 2 higher than you.  
    [[UNCLEAR: Two different scaling rules are given (“per Sequence” and “per character”); it is unclear whether both apply, and what “character” means here.]]

- Generally speaking, the rulings you can enforce are as follows:

#### Misdemeanor offenses

(harassment, abuse, stealing/taking things of no value to the original owner, etc.; offenses against public morals are also crimes)

1. **“Leave!”**: The target must perform a **movement action** [[LINK LATER: Movement action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]] immediately, and the direction of all movement actions within 1 round must be away from this place.
2. **“Return it!”**: If the target takes something that does not belong to it and is related to the convicted crime, it is required to return it immediately.
3. **“Apologize!”**: If the target committed a fault and it is related to the crime for which it was convicted, it is immediately forced to apologize.

#### Moderate crimes

(robbery of things important to the original owner, indecent, intentionally wounding, vandalism, burglary, etc.)

1. **“Surrender!”**: The target must confess its crime and criminal intent, and be arrested by you voluntarily; this lasts for 1 round.
2. **“Confession!”**: Similar to but not the same as self-surrender; it does not necessarily admit the crime, but it will expose the criminal process and accomplices.
3. **“Repent!”**: Has the two effects of “Return it!” and “Apologize!” at the same time; regret emerges in the heart; lasts for 1 round.

#### Serious crimes

(attempted/completed murder, intentionally causing serious injury, attempted/completed forced sex, endangering public safety, etc.)

1. **“Follow the law!”**: The target cannot perform movement actions for 1 round, nor can it endanger the enforcer/victim.
2. **“Atonement!”**: You designate one or more things owned by the target to be handed over, at most equivalent to the damage it caused. If the damage caused it cannot afford, or it is something that cannot really be recovered, the target needs to self-mutilate/suicide within 1 round.

- Enforceable awards for more serious crimes include content in less serious crimes, and the Arbitrator can expand further awards at their discretion.

> **GM Note:** The severity of crimes is determined by the GM, and theft, fraud, etc. can be judged according to the value involved.

### Vision

> **Lore:** You gain vision, but it is not as effective for you as your own Inspiration.

- **Cost:** 1 **free action** [[LINK LATER: Free action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]; consume 1 spirituality point per round.
- **Use:** You activate vision, and your vision gains the following benefits:
  1. **Etheric body:** You can roughly tell whether the other party’s body is good or bad through the color of the aura, but you can’t get detailed information.
  2. **Spiritual body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality, which cannot identify extraordinary people.
  3. **Mental body:** You can see whether the other party is thinking, but only so, and you cannot get more detailed information.
  4. **Astral body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5. When in the state of spiritual vision, your [[LINK LATER: Spiritual intuition test | type=mechanic | hint=spiritual intuition check/appraisal]] is beneficial +1.
- **Notes:**
  - Creatures that are dead are usually dull in color and cannot be identified.
  - Spiritual materials are usually spiritual, but you cannot determine the corresponding path. [[LINK LATER: Pathway | type=term | hint=Pathway identification rules]]
  - The colors seen by the spirit vision allow you to see each other in the dark, but you can only see the existence of colors, and it is still possible to get lost in the dark, because the colors you can see are limited; you cannot use them to distinguish the undead biology.
  - Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default, which have not dissipated for 24 hours.
- **Limits:**
  - Spirit Vision cannot be recorded or stolen.
