# Sequence 7: Interrogator

- You become proficient with various weapons and an expert in blasting.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- Horn of the flashing black snake ×1 [[LINK LATER: Flashing Black Snake Horn | type=item | hint=advancement material]]
- Dust of the spirit of the lake ×1 [[LINK LATER: Spirit of the Lake Dust | type=item | hint=advancement material]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** strength +1, constitution +2, agility +1

- Whenever you successfully interrogate a creature and obtain a key, non-repetitive piece of information, choose **one** of the following to increase by 1 level: intimidate / speak / please / persuade.  
  - The number of growth times and the upper limit are equal to the reputation growth of Sequence 9. [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9 Reputation Growth | type=mechanic | hint=growth times and cap reference]]

### Weapon Proficiency

- **Effect:** While you have this ability, your skills in using various weapons are treated as mastery (in terms of skills). [[LINK LATER: Skill Mastery | type=mechanic | hint=mastery tier for skills]]
- **Limits:**
  1. This does **not** include identification of spellcasting such as occultism / inspiration. [[LINK LATER: Occultism | type=term | hint=spellcasting identification]] [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=spellcasting identification]]
  2. This **does** include fighting (including subdivision) / throwing / shooting (including subdivision) / blasting / cannon, etc. [[LINK LATER: Fighting | type=term | hint=skill (including subdivisions)]] [[LINK LATER: Throwing | type=term | hint=skill]] [[LINK LATER: Shooting | type=term | hint=skill (including subdivisions)]] [[LINK LATER: Blasting | type=term | hint=skill]] [[LINK LATER: Cannon | type=term | hint=skill]]
- **Progression:**
  1. Each time you practice at least 2 hours of the corresponding skill training, your ability can rise to the corresponding level.
  2. The growth rate and number of times are equal to skill fighting. [[LINK LATER: Fighting Skill Growth | type=mechanic | hint=baseline growth rate and growth-count reference]]
- **Notes:** This is a passive ability that cannot be recorded, but can be stolen. [[LINK LATER: Ability Recording | type=mechanic | hint=recording abilities]] [[LINK LATER: Ability Theft | type=mechanic | hint=stealing abilities]]

### Spirit Piercing

> **Lore:** This is a means to directly attack the spirit body, bringing coercion at the spirit-body level—gathering spirit, piercing the target’s spirit body, and directly attacking their spirit.

> **Lore:** Manifestation form: two lightning bolts suddenly light up in your eyes; the enemy will scream, and the spirit will be pierced by a sharp knife.

[[UNCLEAR: The ability is described as targeting the “spirit body,” but its mechanics reference “mental puncture” and deal “mental damage,” and the relationship between these terms is not defined here.]]

1. **Preparation (Fear)**
   - **Use:** 1 **swift action** [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
   - **Cost:** Does not consume spirituality. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource points]]
   - **Targeting and range:** Select 1 target within your field of vision. [[LINK LATER: Field of Vision | type=mechanic | hint=targeting constraint]]
   - **Effect:**
     - This is a preparation state for mental puncture.
     - During the maintenance period, no other extraordinary abilities can be used. [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Abilities | type=term | hint=ability category]]
     - The target gains a **Fear** state, and it does not have the effect of forced movement. [[LINK LATER: Fear | type=condition | hint=status]] [[LINK LATER: Forced Movement | type=mechanic | hint=movement forced by effects]]
   - **Special (rank):** This halves the effect on targets higher than your rank, and has no effect on targets higher than a rank. [[LINK LATER: Rank | type=mechanic | hint=relative power tier comparison]]

2. **Pierce (Damage + Stun)**
   - **Use:** 1 **swift action** [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
   - **Frequency:** 1 time per round [[LINK LATER: Round | type=mechanic | hint=timing unit]]
   - **Cost:** Consumes 3 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource points]]
   - **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within your field of vision. [[LINK LATER: Field of Vision | type=mechanic | hint=targeting constraint]]
   - **Check:** inspiration + charisma against physical defense; ignores armor. [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=check component]] [[LINK LATER: Charisma | type=term | hint=check component]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense value]] [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=mechanic | hint=ignored by this check]]
   - **Effect (on success):** Deal 1d6 mental damage and apply a **Stunned** state. [[LINK LATER: Mental Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] [[LINK LATER: Stunned | type=condition | hint=status]]
   - **Interaction with (1):** The use of (2) does not need to consume 1 more swift action due to (1), but therefore (2) will not cause the fear effect.

[[UNCLEAR: It is not stated whether step (2) requires step (1) to be active, or how the “maintenance period” timing interacts with using step (2).]]

### Whip of Pain

> **Lore:** The target feels as if electric currents are passing through their minds, forming thorny whips that constantly beat the soul.

1. **Ready State (Fear)**
   - **Use:** 1 **swift action** [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
   - **Cost:** Does not consume spirituality. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource points]]
   - **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within your field of vision. [[LINK LATER: Field of Vision | type=mechanic | hint=targeting constraint]]
   - **Effect:**
     - You enter a ready state.
     - During the maintenance period, you cannot use other extraordinary abilities. [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Abilities | type=term | hint=ability category]]
     - Endow the target with a **Fear** state. [[LINK LATER: Fear | type=condition | hint=status]]
     - The target clearly feels that the whip formed by the electric current is located in the mind.
   - **Special (sequence/level restriction):** Only for targets lower than your sequence level or level: their movement is halved due to trembling and knees becoming soft. [[LINK LATER: Sequence Level | type=mechanic | hint=relative sequence/level comparison]] [[LINK LATER: Movement | type=mechanic | hint=movement rate]]
   - **Other:** The rest of the determination is the same as that of mental piercing, and the target affected by this ability will continue to feel the pain and the lifting of the invisible whip. [[LINK LATER: Mental Piercing | type=mechanic | hint=referenced determination rules]]

2. **Cast / Accompany Weapon**
   - **Use:** 1 **spellcasting**/**attack action** [[LINK LATER: Spellcasting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]] [[LINK LATER: Attack Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
   - **Cost:** Consuming 2 spirituality. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource points]]
   - **Modes:**
     - **Cast alone (spellcasting action):**
       - **Check:** inspiration + intimidation check against physical defense; ignores armor. [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=check component]] [[LINK LATER: Intimidation | type=term | hint=check component]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense value]] [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=mechanic | hint=ignored by this check]]
       - **Effect (on success):** Cause 1d6 mental damage. [[LINK LATER: Mental Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]]
       - **After damage:** The target’s movement is halved for 1 round, rounded up. [[LINK LATER: Movement | type=mechanic | hint=halving rule]] [[LINK LATER: Round | type=mechanic | hint=timing unit]]
       - Other creatures gain advantages/disadvantages against them, which cannot be superimposed. [[LINK LATER: Advantage/Disadvantage | type=mechanic | hint=non-stacking modifier]]
       [[UNCLEAR: “Other creatures gain advantages/disadvantages against them” does not specify which applies (advantage vs disadvantage), to what rolls, or under what conditions.]]

     - **Accompanying weapon (attacking action):**
       - Perform the confrontation identification corresponding to the weapon, and cause corresponding damage. [[LINK LATER: Confrontation Identification | type=mechanic | hint=weapon resolution check]]
       - It can only be a melee weapon. [[LINK LATER: Melee Weapon | type=term | hint=weapon category]]
       - The accompanying weapon effect should not be an extraordinary ability produced by a spell-casting action. [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Abilities | type=term | hint=ability category]]
       - Range note: casting alone is a long-range effect, and accompanying weapon is a melee effect. [[LINK LATER: Range Bands | type=mechanic | hint=long-range vs melee]]
       - If you use it as an accompanying weapon, you only need the confrontation identification corresponding to the weapon to produce the two effects of the weapon itself and the Whip of Pain at the same time.
       - **Resolution vs physical defense:**
         - When the result of the identification > physical defense (including armor), the two effects will be produced at the same time. [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense (Including Armor) | type=mechanic | hint=defense comparison]]
         - When the result of the identification > physical defense (excluding armor), only the Whip of Pain effect will be produced. [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense (Excluding Armor) | type=mechanic | hint=defense comparison]]
