# Sequence 5: Discipline Paladin

> **Lore:** Violators should be punished.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual (unofficial):**
  - Face up to the crimes you have committed.
  - Assume responsibility to make up for your mistakes.
  - Tolerate no injustice, even the slightest.
  - Make yourself a completely innocent person.
  - Promote only after confirming you will no longer bear any sins.

### Promotion Effects

- At the moment of promotion, a Beyonder may appear loyal to the law, but may not be innocent enough; this is a major taboo for promotion to disciplinary knights.
- For every fault in the life of a Beyonder that has not been made up for, the Beyonder must accept the corresponding punishment; at the moment of promotion, the Beyonder suffers **one injury** per such fault. [[LINK LATER: Injury | type=condition | hint=injury/wound taken at promotion]]
- The more mistakes, the more the Beyonder is torn apart, and may eventually:
  - Die on the spot, **or**
  - Collapse into a monster because the law enforcers violated the order. [[LINK LATER: Law Enforcers | type=faction | hint=entities enforcing order during promotion]]
- Even minor crimes (e.g., crossing the road) require self-punishment.
- Only when all crimes are punished as they should be punished can the Beyonder be promoted safely.
- Generally speaking, anyone will break the law inadvertently in their life, so it is dangerous to assume one’s ordinary life is just and straightforward.
- The fewer sins left unpaid, the easier it is to succeed in promotion.
- Generally speaking, it is safe to have **3 sins** left unpaid. [[UNCLEAR: The text says all crimes must be punished for safe promotion, yet also says having 3 unpaid sins is generally safe.]]
- Because it is generally impossible to completely count unconscious violations, it is normal to feel at least intense torture during promotion.
- Once the promotion is completely completed, the Beyonder will feel a new life.

> **Lore:** “Those who try to hold a sword must first stab the sword at themselves, and make a corresponding awareness.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +2, Agility +1.
- All your attack skills can be learned to upgrade to knowledge. [[UNCLEAR: “upgrade to knowledge” is undefined and may reference another subsystem.]]

- **Retribution:** You gain the following laws related to punishment. [[LINK LATER: Laws | type=mechanic | hint=extraordinary laws usable by Beyonders]]

### The Violator Shall Be Punished!

- **Use:** 1 **Attack Action**. [[LINK LATER: Attack Action | type=term | hint=action type used to attack]]
- **Cost:** Consume 2 **Spiritual Points**. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Points | type=term | hint=resource spent to activate laws]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within 50 meters that violates your **Forbidden Law**. [[LINK LATER: Forbidden Law | type=mechanic | hint=your declared forbidden rule a target can violate]]
- **Effect:** Make 1 **Melee Attack**. [[LINK LATER: Melee Attack | type=mechanic | hint=close-range attack resolution]] This attack must hit (guaranteed hit).
- **Limits:** This cannot be used with [[LINK LATER: Death | type=mechanic | hint=law]] / [[LINK LATER: Whiplash | type=mechanic | hint=law]] and other laws.

> **GM Note:** Example: even if a giant dragon is flying in the air, you can bounce up at once, jump higher than the dragon can fly, and achieve the inevitable-hit effect in an unreasonable form.

### Punishment Target: Biological Type

- **Use:** 1 **Attack Action**. [[LINK LATER: Attack Action | type=term | hint=action type used to attack]]
- **Cost:** Consume 3 **Spiritual Points**. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Points | type=term | hint=resource spent to activate laws]]
- **Targeting and range:** Designate 1 target within 50 meters, then name the corresponding **creature type**. [[LINK LATER: Creature Type | type=term | hint=classification named when using punishment targeting]]
- **Effect:** Perform 1 **Melee Attack**. [[LINK LATER: Melee Attack | type=mechanic | hint=close-range attack resolution]]
  - Increase damage by **1d6**.
  - Change the **damage type** to the type that can traumatize the enemy to the greatest extent (see below). [[LINK LATER: Damage Type | type=term | hint=damage category such as holy/cold/fire]]
- **Limits:** This change excludes **psychic damage**. [[LINK LATER: Psychic Damage | type=term | hint=excluded damage type for punishment conversion]]

> **GM Note:** Example: “Punishment objects: resentful souls and ghosts!” While gaining extra damage, your attack is changed to **holy damage**.

#### Damage Type Conversion

1. **Holy damage:** [[LINK LATER: Holy Damage | type=term | hint=damage type used vs certain undead targets]]
   - When the punishment target is ghost/wraith/living corpse/skeleton/Rose bishop/vampire/demon, the attack changes to holy damage.
   - It gains an additional **1d6** damage restraint effect only when facing **undead creatures**. [[LINK LATER: Undead | type=term | hint=creature category referenced by holy damage clause]]
2. **Curse damage:** [[LINK LATER: Curse Damage | type=term | hint=damage type used vs low curse resistance]]
   - Change when the punishment target is human/other living creatures/any creature with the lowest curse resistance.
3. **Cold damage:** [[LINK LATER: Cold Damage | type=term | hint=damage type used vs low cold resistance]]
   - Change when the punishment target is gargoyle/golem/any creature with the lowest cold resistance.
   - The hit creature suffers **-2 disadvantage** on the next identification within **1 round**, and its movement power is halved (round up). [[LINK LATER: Disadvantage | type=mechanic | hint=numeric disadvantage modifier]] [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=the “identification” check referenced here]] [[LINK LATER: Movement Power | type=term | hint=movement capacity referenced by halving effect]]
   - Sexual creatures are void. [[UNCLEAR: “Sexual creatures are void” is undefined (unclear which creatures are exempt or how).]]
4. **Fire damage:** [[LINK LATER: Fire Damage | type=term | hint=damage type used vs low fire resistance]]
   - Change when the punishment target is a frozen creature/spider silk/plant/any creature with the lowest fire resistance.
5. **Poison damage:** [[LINK LATER: Poison Damage | type=term | hint=damage type used vs low poison resistance]]
   - Change when the punishment target is plant/spider silk/poisoned creature/any creature with the lowest poison resistance.

- **Special:** Punishment abilities can also shift if there are more valid damage types, but excluding psychic damage. [[LINK LATER: Damage Type | type=term | hint=damage category such as holy/cold/fire]]
- When multiple resistances of a certain creature are the same, the GM chooses one of the most effective damage types to change. [[LINK LATER: Resistance | type=mechanic | hint=creature resistances used to select conversion type]]

### The Guilty Shall Be Restrained!

- **Use:** 1 **Spellcasting Action**. [[LINK LATER: Spellcasting Action | type=term | hint=action type used to cast a law]]
- **Cost:** Consume 3 **Spiritual Points**. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Points | type=term | hint=resource spent to activate laws]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target within 50 meters.
- **Effect:**
  - Choose the crime of the target and announce the crime (e.g., “illegal trespassing into another person’s house is a crime”), then connect with “the guilty shall be restricted!”

[[LINK LATER: Dexterity | type=term | hint=attribute referenced by restraint]] [[LINK LATER: Evasion | type=term | hint=defensive stat referenced by restraint]] [[LINK LATER: Mobility | type=term | hint=category for movement/defense referenced here]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=term | hint=defense category referenced here]] [[LINK LATER: Disadvantage | type=mechanic | hint=numeric disadvantage modifier]]
