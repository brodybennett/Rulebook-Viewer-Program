# Sequence 0: Justicar

> **Lore:** To a certain extent, the rules at the bottom of the world can be modified.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual (unofficial):** Make your existence and name (including your [[LINK LATER: True Name | type=term | hint=the name that can be recited to affect or target you]]) almost conceptual, becoming a proxy for the rules of the world. Initiate a trial of a god’s crimes that have had a long-term impact on the world, and cause punishment that can substantially affect the other party. After the god is punished or guilty, then take the [[LINK LATER: Potion | type=item | hint=Sequence advancement potion]].
  [[UNCLEAR: The ritual’s completion condition (“punished or guilty”) is ambiguous in the source text.]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Charisma +1, Inspiration +1, Dexterity +1, Strength +1, Constitution +1.
- [[LINK LATER: Law skill | type=term | hint=skill and its “skill level” scale]] increased by 1 skill level.

### Divine Gaze

- **Effect:** You can gaze at the surroundings of any creature that recites your [[LINK LATER: True Name | type=term | hint=the name that can be recited to affect or target you]], and use your extraordinary ability to target the area at will.
  [[UNCLEAR: “Use your extraordinary ability to target the area at will” does not specify which abilities qualify or what normal targeting limits still apply.]]

### Origin of Order

- **Effect:** You can modify the underlying rules of the world to a certain extent, making things that were impossible in the underlying order possible.
