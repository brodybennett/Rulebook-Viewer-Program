# Sequence 0: Error

> **Lore:** The Trojan horse of fate, the worm of time, the loophole of rules, the incarnation of all mistakes.

## Error

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ceremony:** In someone else's ceremony of becoming a god [[LINK LATER: Ceremony of Becoming a God | type=ritual | hint=apotheosis ceremony referenced by this Sequence]], take his place.

## Extraordinary Abilities

You gain the following extraordinary abilities:

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +1, Dexterity +1.
- Your deceit and skill level up by one skill level. [[UNCLEAR: It is not specified whether “deceit” and “skill” are specific skills/ratings or a general description of skill increases.]]

### BUG

- **Use:** 1 **free action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy term]].
- **Limits:** Can only be used once per round.
- **Effect:** You can make any loopholes in the logic of rules and destiny come true.
- **Effect notes:**
  - The stronger the connection and association is, the more feasible it is. Otherwise, it is difficult to succeed.
  - It is difficult to succeed, especially for the same personality; but you can almost use this ability without any logic in the face of low-level personality, especially the Sequence that even the king of angels has not yet reached. [[LINK LATER: King of Angels | type=term | hint=high-rank entity title]] [[UNCLEAR: The trailing “1.” appears to be a misplaced Sequence reference or footnote marker.]]
- **Example:**
  - Your main body [[LINK LATER: Main Body | type=term | hint=primary self vs. avatars]] is teleported, and your avatar [[LINK LATER: Avatar | type=term | hint=projected/secondary body]] is the main body to some extent, so all your avatars and main body can be teleported.

In order for the "wrong" authority [[LINK LATER: “Wrong” Authority | type=mechanic | hint=the authority described as “wrong” in this ability]] to take effect at the same level, there are often different prerequisites:

1. The medium and the target are sufficiently similar.
2. There is a certain relationship between the two.
3. Some things and things have logical contradictions.
4. Some rules do have imperfections.
5. Not to directly affect the goal, but to build an environment full of "errors" in the form of creating the Kingdom of God [[LINK LATER: Kingdom of God | type=location | hint=divine realm/constructed domain]]...
