# Sequence 5: Spirit Warlock

> **Lore:** Your control over spirits improves greatly. You are skilled at driving **Natural Spirits** and can seal both natural spirits and resentful ghost shadows on your teeth, gaining their abilities and assistance.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Let a **powerful spirit body** possess you and take over your physical body. After you completely give up control of your body and spiritual perception, the spirit takes the [[LINK LATER: Potion | type=item | hint=advancement potion]] instead. (Unofficial ceremony.)
- **Powerful spirit body standard:** Whether or not it has extraordinary characteristics, its power should be enough to make an Extraordinary feel “a certain amount of trouble.”
- **Effect:** Upon promotion, the Extraordinary’s perception of the soul is greatly enhanced. This causes them to hear many whispers and ravings from the [[LINK LATER: Spirit World | type=location | hint=pervasive spirit realm]] or from real spirit bodies, because the Spirit World is everywhere and this influence cannot be completely isolated. Therefore, the Extraordinary needs a powerful enough spirit body to take over their body so it can protect the Extraordinary’s spirit. In this situation, the Extraordinary themself loses the ability to take potions and protect themself, so a spirit body is needed to stabilize the process.
- **Note:** The spirit body must be carefully selected and trustworthy. Otherwise, even if promotion succeeds, the Extraordinary may suffer losses and be squeezed out of their own spirituality, becoming the second body of that spirit body.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute]] +2, [[LINK LATER: Constitution | type=term | hint=attribute]] +1, [[LINK LATER: Will | type=term | hint=attribute]] +1.

### Spirit Seal

- **Seal:** 1 [[LINK LATER: Spell-Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]. Choose a helpless/voluntary [[LINK LATER: Spirit Body | type=term | hint=incorporeal entity]] in front of you and seal it onto one of your teeth.
- **Capacity:** The number of your teeth determines the number of spirit bodies you can seal. Adults are usually 28–32 capsules.
- **Release:** As a [[LINK LATER: Quick Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]], tap your teeth to release a sealed spirit body to fight alongside you.

### Drive the Soul

- **Effect:** If you release at least one sealed spirit body, you can manipulate released spirits to act for you **without taking an action**.
- **Spirit action types:** The spirits you can manipulate are usually divided into two types:
  1. **Nature Spirit:** Each round has 1 casting/[[LINK LATER: Attack Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]] and 1 [[LINK LATER: Move Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]. Either action can be converted into 2 [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]], and the converted actions cannot be executed.
  2. **Undead:** Has only 1 action per round. It can be used as an attack/casting or move action. This action can also be converted into 2 swift actions.
- **Special:** Regardless of type, spirits can:
  - use their extraordinary abilities,
  - drive your [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Items | type=item | hint=items usable by spirits]],
  - use your ability to recite poems (you must teach them the corresponding poems first). [[LINK LATER: Poem Recitation | type=mechanic | hint=teaching spirits poems]]
- **Ease-of-play stats:** For ease of calculation:
  1. The spirit body’s skill and attribute appraisal value equals your Inspiration, and its existing [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term | hint=mental stability pool]] equals its [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]].
  2. If a situation needs separate calculation, discuss with the [[LINK LATER: GM | type=term | hint=game moderator]] to use the original value. The “identification equals Inspiration” mechanism exists to reduce skill calculation when handling many sealed spirits.

#### Spirits You Can Animate

In general, you can animate the following spirits:

- **Natural spirit** (combined with the Spirit World; a naturally produced spirit body, not transformed from the dead; power comes from the Spirit World)
  - A natural spirit usually has an extraordinary ability and does not have extraordinary characteristics.
  - Natural spirits that have appeared in the original book include:
    - **Dread Banshee:** A powerful spiritual creature with 50 health, 25 physical (agility and dodge 10), and 20 Will Defense. It has a beautiful face, a rotten body, and a pair of huge eagle wings.
      - 1 attack action: Use your Inspiration instead of its check against [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]], dealing 3d6 [[LINK LATER: Mental Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]]. On a successful attack, the target’s Will attribute is temporarily -1 and the target is in a state of [[LINK LATER: Fear | type=condition | hint=mental influence]] for 1 round.
    - **Goddess of the Lake:** A spiritual creature with 60 health, 20 Physical Defense (agility and dodge 10), and 15 Will Defense. When it appears, it is accompanied by lake water shrouded in mist; central ripples sway in circles and slowly float up; a beautiful yet illusory figure.
      - 1 casting action: Choose 1 target. Choose one benefit:
        1. Within 1 round, the next skill and attribute appraisal +2 will be beneficial.
        2. For 1 round, one of the [[LINK LATER: Three Defenses | type=mechanic | hint=the system’s three defense stats]] gets a +2 bonus.
        3. Within 1 round, gain 5 points of extra life, or extra [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource pool]]; only one can be gained at the same time; this cannot be stacked.
        4. Within 1 round, the mental influence (fear, anger, etc., other than shock) suffered by the target is halved. The effect of [[LINK LATER: Forced Movement | type=mechanic | hint=movement imposed by effects]] is cleared, rounded up, and completely removed after the second application of the ability. The mental influence includes temporary madness but not “others crazy.”
  - > **GM Note:** Other possible natural spirits are numerous. You may write additional natural spirits and submit them to the GM for review, ensuring they are logical and GM-approved. Examples mentioned in the source include rare natural spirits that can carry their masters to sneak underground, and weak-but-special natural spirits that can fight with spirit witches or share senses for investigation. [[LINK LATER: Spirit Witch | type=other | hint=entity referenced as “spirit witches”]]

- **Undead** (spirit bodies transformed from emissaries who have not been properly buried and requiemed)
  - **Shadow:** 15 health, 15 Physical Defense (5 for agility and dodge), and 10 Will Defense; 5 points of [[LINK LATER: Cold Resistance | type=mechanic | hint=resistance]].
    - Attack action: Deal 1d6 [[LINK LATER: Cold Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]]. No other abilities.
  - **Wraith/Evil Spirit:** 30 health, 20 Physical Defense (10 for agility and dodge), and 10 Will Defense; 10 points of cold resistance.
    - Attack action: Deal 2d6 cold damage.
    - 1 move action: Overlap with a target’s body; the wraith can [[LINK LATER: Possession | type=condition | hint=inhabiting a target body]] the target.
    - While possessing: It can manipulate the body and use its extraordinary ability. The possessed target can perform a spell-casting action each round, and consumes an additional swift action to extend spirituality to resist. Causing [[LINK LATER: Holy Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] / [[LINK LATER: Lightning Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] / [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] to wraiths can lift possession.
    - **Note:** Any damage to the possessed person also damages the resentful soul, but the resentful soul generally ignores [[LINK LATER: Physical Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]] and [[LINK LATER: Poison Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]].
  - > **GM Note:** Unlike resentful souls of different species, wild undead do not gain abilities such as advanced invisibility from level; they can only deal cold damage, and only gain possession after a certain level. Ordinary shadows do not even meet the conditions for possession. For other undead, they generally seek extraordinary abilities; aside from their own spirit-body traits, they can only rely on extraordinary characteristics to become Extraordinary.

#### Other Spirit Body Characteristics

1. Any spirit body with HP reaching 50 can be called **powerful**. Any ordinary resentful soul/ghost or spirit body of the same level immediately suffers the fear effect the moment it faces it, with forced movement out of fear.  
   **Special:** Spirits affected by fear immediately flee to a place they believe is safe and give up fighting (e.g., fleeing to the gatekeeper’s inner body of the [[LINK LATER: Underworld | type=location | hint=realm referenced with “gatekeeper”]]). This “powerful” spirit likely belongs to the level of Sequence 6–5. [[LINK LATER: Gatekeeper | type=other | hint=entity referenced as “gatekeeper”]]
2. A spirit with a blood limit of 30 can continue to consume 1 movement action to help the owner fly. This flight does not consume the owner’s own movement action, but the movement force equals your Inspiration, and the speed is not doubled.
3. All spirits ignore physical damage and poison damage, and have [[LINK LATER: Night Vision | type=term | hint=vision trait]]. Additional resistances are listed separately.
