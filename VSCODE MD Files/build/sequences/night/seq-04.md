# Sequence 4: Night Watcher

> **Lore:** Brings misfortune to others and excels at dealing with spirit creatures.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** To resist a disaster that covers the entire night; in the course of fulfilling one’s duty, stand firm under strong pressure for a night, until dawn is approaching. (unofficial ceremony)

### Substitution

- **Substitution:** Through the power of the sleeping or undead domain, integrate into your own blood the corresponding main body parts of descendants of high-level beings or undead connected with that power. Only the corresponding main body parts are required.
  - Example: After such a descendant dies, spiritual skulls or other important parts may remain; skulls that have been dead for a long time may still possess spirituality. (unofficial ceremony)
