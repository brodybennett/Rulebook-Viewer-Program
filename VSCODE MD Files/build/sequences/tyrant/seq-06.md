[[LINK LATER: Wind Domain | type=mechanic]]

You gain the following wind-based abilities.

---

### Short-Distance Flight

- **Cost:** 1 swift action, 1 spirituality

- **Targeting and Range:** You may take off together with creatures within 5 meters.  
- **Special:**  
  - While performing short-distance flight, you are considered to have **Fast Dodge**.

### Create Air Cushions

- **Cost:** 1 swift action, 2 spirituality  
- **Targeting and Range:** Up to a 10-meter area  
- **Effect:**  
  1. Creatures and objects moving on the air cushion make no sound; stealth identification automatically succeeds. The cushion has no physical volume.  
  2. Falling creatures landing on an air cushion are immune to fall damage. If falling from more than 100 meters, an additional cushion layer must be created every 100 meters to continuously reduce impact.  

---

### Wind Blade

- **Cost:** 1 spellcasting action; 1 spirituality per shot  
- **Targeting and Range:** One or more targets within 50 meters  
- **Check:** Inspiration + piloting vs physical defense  
- **Effect:** Each wind blade deals 2d6 physical damage. Speed is treated as a firearm.  
- **Limits:**  
  1. One casting action allows up to 3 consecutive shots; each may target a different creature.  
  2. When repeatedly attacking the same target, hit identification improves instead of decreasing; from the second shot onward, each shot gains a cumulative +2 benefit.  
  3. If you can release Wind Blade as a swift action, that version inherits the bonus above.  
- **Manifestation:** Impacts leave cuts like blades across surfaces.  
- **Sequence 5 Change:** Damage increases by 1d6.  

---

### Wind Bind

- **Cost:** 1 spellcasting action, 3 spirituality  
- **Target:** 1 creature  
- **Check:** Inspiration vs target’s Agility  
- **Effect:** On success, the target gains the [[LINK LATER: Bound | type=condition]] state and cannot perform movement actions.

---

### Wind Attachment

- **Cost:** 1 swift action, 1 spirituality  
- **Effect:** Choose one effect for 1 round:

1. **Hand:** Your right fist is wrapped in high-speed wind. One attack action that round deals +1d6 physical damage; applies to combo attacks.  
2. **Legs:** While walking or running on land, your movement force increases by +15 for 1 round. Allies within 5 meters gain this benefit.  
3. **Weapons:** The Hand effect can be applied to weapons, arrows, or firearms without changing their speed.  

- **Special (Legs):** While active, you are considered to have Fast Dodge. Against firearms (not light/lightning), retain full physical defense and gain +1 dodge level (or +1 level if already having Fast Dodge).  
- **Sequence 5 Change:** Allies within 10 meters benefit.  

---

### Sound Transmission

### Create a Gale

- **Cost:** 1 spellcasting action, 3 spirituality  
- **Area:** All targets within 50 meters in front of you  
- **Effect:**  
  - You gain 20 points of forced movement.  
  - Targets are blown up to 20 meters until beyond the 50-meter area.  

**Balance and Distance Rules**

1. Creatures make an Agility check (Difficulty Value 20) or lose balance. If voluntarily moving 5 meters with the wind, they gain +2 to maintain balance.  
2. Creatures that lose balance have their blown distance doubled (round up).  
3. For each 1 point of creature size above small, forced movement distance is reduced by 2 meters. Small or tiny creatures automatically lose balance and have distance doubled.  

**Additional Wind Uses**

4. **Extinguish Flames:** 1 swift action, 1 spirituality. In a chosen direction, extinguish flames within 50 meters. Fire abilities requiring combustibles cannot ignite. Fire abilities not requiring combustibles suffer −2 disadvantage toward you and −1d6 damage.  
5. **Damage Reduction:** 1 swift action, 2 spirituality. When hit by strength-based damage dice, move backward with wind and reduce that damage by 1d6.  
6. **Ally Push:** 1 swift action, 2 spirituality. When a creature within 50 meters is about to be targeted by a single-target attack, push it away; the attack suffers −6 disadvantage.  

- **Maintenance:** You may spend 1 spirituality each round to sustain the gale.  
- **Sequence 5 Change:** Maximum ranges become 100 meters; maximum blown distance becomes 40 meters.

### Extended Wind Logic

- With GM approval, other logical wind-control uses are allowed.  
- If an ability that pushes creatures interacts with the [[LINK LATER: Sequence 7 Water Spell | type=sequence | hint=Lubrication effect]], pushing distance is increased accordingly.
