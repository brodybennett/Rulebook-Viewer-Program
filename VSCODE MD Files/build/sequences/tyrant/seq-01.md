# Sequence 1: Thunder God

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

> **Lore:** A ceremony of standing before the overwhelming force of nature and accepting one’s insignificance before thunder.

- **Advancement Ritual:**  
  Create or find a location capable of resisting thunderstorms approaching [[LINK LATER: Sequence 0 | type=sequence]] intensity. Attract a vast number of thunder-attributed phenomena (described as “thunder forests”).  
  As the location’s layered defenses are destroyed one layer at a time, the participant must:
  - Experience fear and surrender.
  - Recognize their own insignificance before nature.  
  Consume the potion when only the final defensive layer remains. After consumption, the user merges with the thunder that breaks the final defense, releasing a dazzling thunderburst that can reach back toward those thunder phenomena.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “Thunder forests” and the exact scale of the defensive structure are not mechanically defined.]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Agility +1, Constitution +2

---

### Become Thunder

- **Cost:** 5 Spiritual Points  
- **Use:** Full-round action  
- **Duration:** 2 rounds (3 rounds at [[LINK LATER: Sequence 0 | type=sequence]])  
- **Effect:**  
  You transform into a thunderbolt and move at light speed. Your movement rate becomes the speed of light (described as ~300,000 kilometers of movement power), allowing you to reach any intended destination at light speed. This movement can be used to initiate a surprise attack.

  Upon ending movement:
  - You may deal double the damage of [[LINK LATER: Lightning Control | type=ability]] **or**
  - Directly trigger a lightning storm, which requires prior acceleration to a sufficient degree before use.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The mechanical definition of “acceleration to a certain degree” is not specified.]]

- **Limits:**
  - While in lightning form, you cannot use other extraordinary abilities.
  - You may still enter a rage state.
  - You may charge in lightning form as an attack action, dealing lightning damage equal to your Strength damage dice via a fighting test.
  - Your quick dodge skill remains effective even against light-speed strikes.
  - Your dodge skill level increases by +1 while in this state.

### Hundreds of Millions of Thunders and Entanglements

- **Use:** Casting action (can be repeated each round)  
- **Targeting and Range:** Choose a target  
- **Effect:**  
  You create vast, entangled lightning phenomena (described as forest-like lightning and extended electric arcs) and unleash continuous lightning combinations.

  - Make a +25 disaster check against the target’s physical defense.
  - Ignores physical defense derived from Agility and dodge.

  Each lightning bolt costs 1 Spiritual Point. Dark clouds gather and innumerable lightning strikes descend.

  **Base Damage Scaling:**
  - Damage depends on your Strength value (not Strength damage dice).
  - Each point of Strength = 1 lightning bolt.
  - Each bolt deals 1d6 lightning damage.  
  Example: Strength 20 → 20d6 lightning damage.

- **Sustained Casting:**  
  You may spend a casting action each round to maintain continuous strikes.

- **Combo Mechanic:**
  - Gain a combo value equal to your Agility.
  - Each consecutive round of using this ability counts as a combo:
    - Combo value −1.
    - Damage +1d6.
  - Example: Strength 20, Combo 15  
    - First round: 20d6  
    - Second: 21d6 (combo −1)  
    - Third: 22d6 (combo −1)

  When combo value reaches 0:
  - You may continue casting.
  - Damage no longer increases.

  If there is any interruption between combos:
  - Combo value resets.
  - Bonus damage from combos resets.

#### Interaction with Damage Reduction

- Normally a single-target ability, relying on repeated lightning strikes on the same target.
- If the target has damage reduction, reduction may apply to each lightning bolt individually, greatly lowering total damage.

- **Option:** You may expend all remaining combo value:
  - Lightning damage reduction applies only once per use instead of per bolt.
  - You cannot use combo value to increase damage further.
  - You may still maintain continuous casting, but without additional combo damage benefits.
