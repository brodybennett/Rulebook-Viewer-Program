# Tyrant Pathway: Sequence 9

## Sailor

- **Tarot Correspondence:** [[LINK LATER: Tarot Cards | type=other | hint="Pope"]]

> **Lore:** Once called “sea dependents,” Sailors embody dominance across sea, land, and air.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main Material:** [[LINK LATER: Murloc Swim Bladder | type=item]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1.
- **Skill Gain:** Swimming +1 level; Diving +1 level.

### Swimming and Diving Growth

- **Effect:**
  - Each time you receive **2 hours** of non-repetitive, effective guidance relevant to swimming/diving, your Swimming/Diving skill increases by **+1 level**.
  - You can improve “quickly” up to **Proficiency** at most. [[LINK LATER: Skill Levels | type=rule | hint="levels and proficiency"]]
  - [[UNCLEAR: “You need 2, 3, 4 times” is ambiguous—unclear what those counts apply to (per level? per threshold?).]]
- **Notes:**
  - [[UNCLEAR: “When the character has not just been promoted… swimming growth skill… can be increased by the strength/agility of the potion; growth rate = inspiration” is unclear in timing and application.]]
  - [[LINK LATER: Potions | type=item | hint="Strength/Agility potion interactions"]]
  - [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint="growth rate reference"]]

### High-Rank Sensitivity

- **Trigger:** When you see another creature/person who is not using **restraint**. [[LINK LATER: Restraint | type=term | hint="concealment/suppression rules"]]
- **Effect:**
  - Make an **Inspiration Test** at **Difficulty Value 15**. [[LINK LATER: Tests and Difficulty Value | type=rule | hint="Inspiration Test, DV"]]
  - On a successful judgment, you determine whether the target’s level is higher than yours, and roughly how much higher.
  - If the target is higher by **more than 1 position**, you fall into **Fear**. [[LINK LATER: Fear | type=condition | hint="Condition rules"]]
- **Fear Clarification:**
  - Fear applies only toward the **source of fear**.
  - You are not forced to move because of Fear due to friendly targets, but you are still timid.

### Phantom Scale

- **Effect:**
  - You gain **phantom scales** hidden under your skin; when you are injured, the scales emerge to protect you.
  - You gain **+2 Armor** and **+1 External Damage Reduction**. [[LINK LATER: Armor and Damage Reduction | type=rule | hint="Armor, external DR"]]
  - Unless a creature belongs to Sequences such as [[LINK LATER: Machine Pathway | type=pathway]] or [[LINK LATER: Clown Pathway | type=pathway]] (which can accurately grasp their own strength), most creatures cannot securely grab you—hands slip as if catching a giant fish covered in slick scales. [[LINK LATER: Grabbing and Grappling | type=mechanic | hint="grab/escape interaction"]]
  - Even without protective equipment, you can dive to **15 meters** below the water surface and move freely underwater for **10 minutes**.
- **Sequence Upgrade:**
  - Each time you upgrade your **Sequence**:
    - Armor and External Damage Reduction **+1**
    - Diving depth **+15 meters**
    - Free underwater movement time **+15 minutes**

### Water Breathing

- **Effect:** You gain passive water breathing.
  - You can maintain normal breathing underwater.
  - Base duration is up to **10 minutes** (matched with **Phantom Scale**’s baseline underwater duration).
- **Sequence Boost:** Each boost sequence increases your underwater breathing duration by **+15 minutes**.

### Balance

- **Effect:** You have excellent balance on unstable footing (e.g., stormy ships, earthquakes).
  - You can no longer be thrown off balance. [[LINK LATER: Balance and Knockdown Rules | type=rule | hint="off-balance effects"]]

### Spirit Vision

- **Use:** **1 Free Action** to activate. [[LINK LATER: Action Types | type=rule | hint="Free Action"]]
- **Cost:** While active, spend **1 Spirituality Point per round**. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=term | hint="resource rules"]]
- **Effect:** While Spirit Vision is active, you gain the following perception:
  1) **Etheric Body:** You can roughly judge whether a target’s physical condition is good or bad from aura color, but you cannot obtain detailed information.
  2) **Spiritual Body:** You can confirm whether an object/creature has spirituality, but you cannot identify extraordinary people.
  3) **Mental Body:** You can tell whether a target is thinking, but cannot learn more detailed information.
  4) **Astral Body:** You cannot see the astral body.
  5) You gain **+1** to your **Spiritual Intuition** test. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition | type=term | hint="test rules"]]
- **Notes:**
  - Dead creatures are usually dull in color and may not be identifiable.
  - Many spiritual materials are “spiritual,” but you cannot determine the corresponding Pathway.
  - Aura colors can help you perceive others in darkness, but you only perceive limited colors; you can still get lost in the dark and cannot use color alone to distinguish undead creatures.
  - Spirit Vision can see some ordinary spirit bodies by default if they have not dissipated for **24 hours**; these spirit bodies cannot be recorded or stolen. [[LINK LATER: Spirit Bodies | type=term | hint="duration/recording rules"]]
