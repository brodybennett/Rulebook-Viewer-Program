### Lightning Immunity

- **Effect:** You are immune to lightning damage.  
  [[LINK LATER: Damage Types | type=rule | hint=Lightning damage]]

### Lightning Storm

- **Cost:** 6 [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic]]  
- **Use:** Casting action  
- **Effect:**  
  You create a storm of lightning over an area:
  - Damage: 1d10 + 1d10 + 1d10 + Strength damage die as area lightning damage  
    [[UNCLEAR: “Strength damage die” is not defined—uncertain whether this refers to an attribute-based die or flat modifier.]]
  - Attack Roll: +20 [[LINK LATER: Disaster Attack Roll | type=mechanic]] vs target’s [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic]]  
  - This attack ignores Dexterity and evasion.  
    [[LINK LATER: Evasion | type=mechanic]]

- **Multi-Attack Interaction:**  
  - Lightning Storm is treated as making **at least 5 attacks** for the purpose of substitute-type defenses.  
  - To fully avoid it using substitute skills, at least **3 substitutes** are required, but the confrontation test is performed only once.  
    [[LINK LATER: Substitute Skills | type=mechanic]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Confrontation Test | type=mechanic]]  
  - If the Player’s level is one [[LINK LATER: Sequence | type=rule]] lower, the number of substitutes required increases by +1.  
    [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether this refers to the attacker’s or defender’s Sequence level.]]

- **Split Resolution:**  
  You may divide the effect into three separate instances of lightning damage, calculated separately.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “Divide the identification into three times” interpreted as splitting damage into three separate damage instances.]]

  This also interacts with luck consumption by a [[LINK LATER: Destiny Pathway | type=pathway]] Sequence 5 ability used to avoid a demigod domain ability, doubling the luck consumption.  
  [[LINK LATER: Demigod Domain | type=mechanic]]

- **Weather Interaction:**  
  - In heavy rain, Lightning Storm counts as 5 attacks.  

- **Sequence 2 Upgrade (Future):**  
  > **Lore:** At Sequence 2, the lightning storm becomes a “sea of thunder.”  
  - Damage increases by +1d10.  
  - Base number of attacks becomes 5 (6 in rainy weather).  
  [[LINK LATER: Sequence 2 | type=sequence]]

- **Special Targets:**  
  - Airborne or undead targets take an additional **2d10 lightning damage**.  
    [[LINK LATER: Undead | type=term]]  
  - Targets in a lightning state take an additional **1d10 lightning damage**.  
    [[LINK LATER: Lightning State | type=condition]]

- **Damage Reduction Interaction:**  
  - Damage reduction is applied separately to each lightning damage instance.  
  - Each 1d10 component is reduced individually, including extra damage and Strength-based damage.  
    [[LINK LATER: Damage Reduction | type=mechanic]]

- **Aftereffects (Paralysis):**  
  - Lightning inflicts a paralyzing effect.  
  - Targets with lightning resistance are unaffected by this paralysis.  
    [[LINK LATER: Lightning Resistance | type=mechanic]]  
  - To remove paralysis, the target must use an action (not a free action) to pass a Constitution test with Difficulty 15.  
    [[LINK LATER: Constitution Test | type=mechanic]]  
    [[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=term]]  
  - On failure, the target cannot perform attack or movement actions and does not return to normal until after the opponent’s next round of actions.  
  - If the target is in a wet state, the Difficulty increases to 20.  
    [[LINK LATER: Wet State | type=condition]]

### Ocean Perception

- **Effect:**  
  While in contact with sea water, you can:
  - Perceive events occurring on the waters connected to you.  
  - Observe any location on the sea.  
  - Use your extraordinary abilities anywhere on the sea.  

- **Limits:**  
  - This perception can be affected by anti-divination.  
    [[LINK LATER: Anti-Divination | type=mechanic]]  
  - The effective range is approximately the size of a city.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “City-sized” range is approximate and not mechanically defined.]]
