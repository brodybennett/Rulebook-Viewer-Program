# Sequence 6: Spirit Guide

> **Lore:** Start to set foot in the Spirit World, recruit messengers by yourself, and get help from some Spirit World creatures.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** strength +1, constitution +1, agility +1, inspiration +1.
- **Knowledge of the Dead:** can be learned from the master. [[LINK LATER: Knowledge of the Dead | type=term | hint=skill/check used to interact with spirits and undead]]

### Words of the Dead

- **Effect:** can bypass the protection of flesh and blood, elevating communication with a spirit body to drive or even enslave. [[LINK LATER: Words of the Dead | type=mechanic | hint=communication method that bypasses flesh to affect spirit bodies]]

### Drive the Dead

- **Effect:** the number and quality of natural spirits, undead creatures, and Spirit World creatures you can drive have exploded.
- **Capacity:** from now on, the number of dead you can drive is no longer equal to your inspiration; instead, it equals your **Spirit Body Strength**.
  - **Spirit Body Strength:** your (inspiration + will + half constitution, rounded up) multiplied by twice.
  - This calculation represents the strength of your spirit body. [[LINK LATER: Spirit Body Strength | type=mechanic | hint=spirit-body metric used for driving capacity and related effects]]
- **Sequence 5:** the multiple of undead that can be driven based on the strength of the spirit body is multiplied by 3 times.  
  [[UNCLEAR: It is not clear whether the “×3” at Sequence 5 replaces the “×2” multiplier or is applied in addition.]]

### Language of the Dead

- **Cost:** 1 swift action; consuming 1 spirituality point per round. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Point | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent per round while chanting]]
- **Use:** at the beginning of each round, make 1 **Knowledge of the Dead** identification/check.
- **Targeting and range:** 1 target within 50 meters.
- **Effect:** you chant awkward, jerky, and piercing words the living can never understand, bypassing the physical body and affecting the spiritual body. While you continue chanting, communication with the spirit body is upgraded to drive, even slavery.
- You choose one of the following effects to use:
  1. **Living creature (spirit-body separation)**
     - Check **Knowledge of the Dead** against the target’s spirit body strength (inspiration + will + half constitution). If you succeed, the target’s spirit body floats up uncontrollably and separates from the body inch by inch.  
       [[UNCLEAR: “Spirit Body Strength” is defined earlier with rounding and “×2,” but here it is given as (inspiration + will + half constitution) without rounding or “×2”; the relationship is unclear.]]
     - Judgment of the situation:
       - Each Sequence level the chosen target is higher than yours: -2 penalty on **Knowledge of the Dead** checks.
       - For every 1 character the chosen target is higher than you: -2 disadvantage to the **Knowledge of the Dead** check; if the chosen target is 2 higher than you, ignore the great success.
       - The chosen target has the same Sequence and character as you: no penalty on **Knowledge of the Dead** checks.
       - For each Sequence level the chosen target is lower than you: +2 benefit on **Knowledge of the Dead** checks.
       - For each character the chosen target is lower than you: +2 benefit on **Knowledge of the Dead** checks.
     - Each time your **Knowledge of the Dead** successfully hits the target’s spiritual body strength once, its spiritual body separates by 1 level:
       - Successful identification 1 time: immediately notice the spirit body has begun to separate from the physical body, but there are no negative effects for the time being.
       - Successful identification 2 times: the spirit body is separated from the body in half; 1 spellcasting/attack/swift action/free action is lost; only 1 swift action is left in 1 round.
       - Successful identification 3 times: the spirit body is completely separated from the physical body; it is regarded as an undead creature and enters **Spirit Body State**. [[LINK LATER: Spirit Body State | type=condition | hint=state entered when a spirit body is fully separated]]
     - **Spirit Body State:**
       - **Blood volume** is the value of the strength of the spirit body. For each Sequence level, the upper limit of blood volume +5; for each character, the upper limit of blood volume +10. [[LINK LATER: Blood Volume | type=mechanic | hint=HP-like value; modified by Sequence level and character]]
       - It is regarded as an undead creature.
       - It gains flying ability and 5 points Curse, cold resistance, immune to physical and poison. [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=condition | hint=value-based curse (e.g., “5 points Curse”)]]
       - Sequence 9–8 Extraordinary: gain the characteristic of inflicting 1d6 cold damage in attack action; unable to use own extraordinary ability.
       - Sequence 6–5 Extraordinary: attack actions cause 2d6 cold damage; can use extraordinary abilities; possess wraith possession. [[LINK LATER: Wraith Possession | type=mechanic | hint=possession capability granted in Spirit Body State]]
       - Higher-order Extraordinary: the attack action causes 3d6 cold damage and additionally has the wraith scream. [[LINK LATER: Wraith Scream | type=mechanic | hint=scream effect used by higher-order spirits]]
     - **Warning:** the Extraordinary whose spirit body leaves the physical body will suffer all kinds of targeted blows from undead creatures.
       - Returning to the physical body is a movement action; it fits with its own body, but it needs to use another full-round action to fit into the body.
       - This kind of fit is limited to your own body. Before the fit, any successful **Words of the Dead** will make it leave the body directly.
     > **GM Note:** Similarly, **Language of the Dead** can be used for evil spirits possessing anything; when doing so, treat the strength of the spirit body against evil spirits as if you were choosing a living creature.
  2. **Undead creature (coercive action / enslavement)**
     - Choose 1 undead creature; you upgrade communication to drive and enslave.
     - Check **Knowledge of the Dead** against its spirit strength. After a successful check, you select any one of the freedom/attack/casting/move actions of the undead creature once. [[LINK LATER: Spirit Strength | type=mechanic | hint=undead-facing stat checked against Knowledge of the Dead]]
     - This is based on the premise that an undead creature does not take the initiative to obey your orders.
     - If its level is lower than Sequence 6–5, then as long as your **Knowledge of the Dead** is successfully identified, it will be directly enslaved by you, and it will be regarded as the dead you commanded.
     - Even if it doesn’t take the initiative to obey your orders, if it falls into a helpless state and you use this ability again, you can still enslave it. [[LINK LATER: Helpless State | type=condition | hint=state that enables (re)enslavement]]
     - For a spirit body that has separated from its own body: if it is separated from its body for 72 hours and cannot return, its body is considered dead. time dissipated.  
       [[UNCLEAR: The phrase “time dissipated” is unclear in the 72-hour rule (what dissipates and when).]]
     - The **Words of the Dead** only have the effect of coercive action on natural spirits; because the natural spirits are not dead in essence, and cannot be compelled to enslave.

### Entering the Spirit World

- **Use:** you can enter the Spirit World at the beginning.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The timing/trigger for “at the beginning” is not specified.]]
- **Effect:** in about 5 minutes, you find the entrance of the Spirit World and thus enter the Spirit World.
- **Benefits:** you can directly communicate with spirit bodies and recruit messengers; you may also get help from some Spirit World creatures.
- **Limits:** you will also get lost in the Spirit World, so you should refrain from exploring or ask spirit bodies for directions, and can’t travel through the Spirit World.
- **Reference:** for details about the Spirit World, see [[LINK LATER: Chapter Twelve: Special Regions | type=location | hint=rulebook chapter covering the Spirit World and related procedures]]. You can start to find your own affiliation in the Spirit World. [[LINK LATER: Spirit World Affiliation | type=faction | hint=your affiliation/standing within the Spirit World]]
- **Sequence 5:** with the help of the perception of the underworld, you can use the underworld as a reference standard to know your position in the Spirit World, so that you will no longer get lost. [[LINK LATER: Underworld | type=location | hint=reference plane used for navigation]] [[LINK LATER: Perception of the Underworld | type=mechanic | hint=Sequence 5 feature that prevents getting lost in the Spirit World]]

### Signing the Necromancer Contract

- **Process:**
  1. Prepare a piece of parchment, write down the terms to be observed with the other party, and finally press your hand on the parchment to establish a contractual relationship.
  2. The rest of the contract process is the same as that in [[LINK LATER: Chapter Twelve: Special Regions | type=location | hint=contains necromancer contract process]]. Before Sequence 6, you do not have the ability to sign a necromancer contract, and the necromancer contract can also be used in other fields. [[LINK LATER: Necromancer Contract | type=ritual | hint=contract mechanism for spirit/undead dealings]]
  3. The contract can also be established orally, without parchment; the corresponding content can be chanted directly in ancient Hessian. [[LINK LATER: Ancient Hessian | type=term | hint=language used for oral contract chanting]]
     - In this regard, you can directly refer to the notary’s rules for drafting the contract in Sequence 6 of the Sun Path. [[LINK LATER: Notary Rules | type=rule | hint=contract drafting rules referenced by Necromancer Contract]] [[LINK LATER: Sun Path | type=pathway | hint=the Sun Pathway]]
- **Special:** this is a benefit from the potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.

### Raise Undead

- **Cost:** 1 casting action; consuming 2 spiritual points. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource name as written in Raise Undead cost]]
- **Targeting:** choose 1 unrequited corpse. [[LINK LATER: Unrequited Corpse | type=term | hint=corpse eligible to be raised by Raise Undead]]
- **Effect:** make it “resurrect” as your dead.
- Choose one of the following outcomes:
  1. Corpse that has been dead for less than one month: wake up as a living corpse; the body decay stops, but the existing decay remains. [[LINK LATER: Living Corpse | type=term | hint=undead type raised from recent corpse]]
  2. Corpses that died in water within one month: wake up as water ghosts, and the rest are equivalent to living corpses. [[LINK LATER: Water Ghost | type=term | hint=undead type raised from drowning corpse]]
  3. Corpse that has been dead for more than 1 month: wake up as a skeleton. [[LINK LATER: Skeleton | type=term | hint=undead type raised from older corpse]]
  4. Other possible “resurrections,” shadows or resentful souls, are generally born naturally and cannot be aroused actively. [[LINK LATER: Shadow | type=term | hint=spirit type generally born naturally]] [[LINK LATER: Resentful Soul | type=term | hint=spirit type generally born naturally]]
- **Special:** you should not wake up a living corpse that has been dead for too long. The standard is more than 1 week.
  - The living corpse awakened in this way generally has many places of decay. Any investigation and appraisal against it will be found if it passes a Difficulty Value 15. fester
  - (Decomposition within 1 week can be covered with clothing.)
