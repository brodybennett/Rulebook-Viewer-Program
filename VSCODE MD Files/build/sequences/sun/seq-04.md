# Sequence 4: The Unshadowed

## The Unshadowed

- You can purify depravity, filth, corrosion, darkness, evil, disease, and similar forces, causing them to dissipate quickly until nothing remains.
- Based on this principle, you can remove mental pollution within Extraordinary characteristics. [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Characteristics | type=term | hint=Core Beyonder trait concept]]
- You repel contact with other magical items and Extraordinary characteristics, allowing Extraordinary characteristics to be separated out a little bit. [10] [[LINK LATER: Magical Items | type=item | hint=Core equipment category]]

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main Material:**
  - A drop of “Sun” blood. [[LINK LATER: Sun Blood | type=item | hint=Main material]]
  - *Or instead:* three feathers of an adult sun bird **and** a piece of sacred brilliance stone. [[LINK LATER: Adult Sun Bird Feathers | type=item | hint=Main material]] [[LINK LATER: Sacred Brilliance Stone | type=item | hint=Main material]]
- **Auxiliary Materials:**
  - 60 ml blood of the sun god bird. [[LINK LATER: Sun God Bird Blood | type=item | hint=Auxiliary material]]
  - 30 ml associated liquid of the sacred glow stone. [[LINK LATER: Sacred Glow Stone Liquid | type=item | hint=Auxiliary material]]
  - 7 drops mutated golden hand orange juice. [[LINK LATER: Mutated Golden Hand Orange Juice | type=item | hint=Auxiliary material]]
  - 10 g magma heart powder. [[LINK LATER: Magma Heart Powder | type=item | hint=Auxiliary material]]

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Strip out the strongest and least willing to give up emotions, then take the potion, and infuse these emotions back in the process. [11] [[LINK LATER: Advancement Rituals | type=ritual | hint=Core advancement rules]]

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Agility +1, Inspiration +1, Constitution +1; Religion skill +1 level; Mysticism skill +1 level. [[LINK LATER: Attributes | type=mechanic | hint=Core stats]] [[LINK LATER: Skills | type=mechanic | hint=Core skills]]

### Darkness: Endless Light

- **Use:** 1 **Swift Action**. [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=Action types]]
- **Effect:** Endless light dispels all pollution.
  - There will be no shadows within your vision and the surrounding range. [[LINK LATER: Realm of No Darkness | type=mechanic | hint=Darkness ability effect zone]]
  - The negative effects brought by curses, cold, toxins, and acids cannot be produced. [[LINK LATER: Curses | type=mechanic | hint=Debuff sources]] [[LINK LATER: Toxins | type=mechanic | hint=Poison/toxin rules]]
  - Damage from curses, cold, toxins, and acids can still be caused, but each separately-calculated damage component becomes **1d5**.
    - Example: **2d6 + 2d6** becomes **1d5 + 1d5**.
    - The increased damage of each Sequence level is calculated independently (not combined into a single die pool).
      - Example: Witch’s Black Flame is **3d6**, plus **+1d6** at Sequence 6 and **+1d6** at Sequence 5, so it is **3d6 + 1d6 + 1d6** (not **5d6**). Therefore, in the realm of no darkness, Black Flame at Sequence 5 is **1d5 + 1d5 + 1d5**. [[LINK LATER: Witch Black Flame | type=other | hint=Example attack]]
  - In the realm of no darkness, a creature cannot be dreamed, and an object cannot be concealed or invisible, except for psychological invisibility. [[LINK LATER: Dreaming | type=mechanic | hint=Dream effects]] [[LINK LATER: Invisibility | type=mechanic | hint=Concealment rules]]
    - Psychological invisibility cannot cause sanity damage. [[LINK LATER: Sanity Damage | type=mechanic | hint=Mental harm rules]]
  - Otherwise, the scene is always regarded as daytime.

- **Sequence 3:** The range expands to a radius of 1 kilometer. A physical barrier can appear at the boundary you define, resisting other holy attacks from outside that are lower than your Sequence level. It can also interact with the “Dark Realm” barrier, and/or allow you to shock creatures inside the barrier from range (through the barrier). [[LINK LATER: Holy Attacks | type=mechanic | hint=Damage/attack category]] [[LINK LATER: Dark Realm | type=location | hint=Realm/barrier rules]]
  [[UNCLEAR: The Sequence 3 enhancement text contains multiple clause fragments; barrier interaction and the exact meaning of “invincible for you”/“shock through the barrier” cannot be resolved.]]

### Spear of Darkness

> **Lore:** You accumulate radiance into a spear of pure sunlight and throw it; it can expand into a miniature sun bright enough to illuminate a city.

- **Cost:** 5 points of **Spirituality**. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=Resource pool]]
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**. [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=Action types]]
- **Targeting and range:** Choose 1 target; use **Mysticism** to attack the target’s **Physical Defense**. [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=mechanic | hint=Skill/check type]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=Defense types]]
- **Effect:** On a hit, deal **5d6+8 holy damage**. On a failed attack, the damage is halved. [[LINK LATER: Holy Damage | type=mechanic | hint=Damage types]]
- **Additional effect:** If this attack misses and hits the air, the entire night city enters a short “day” in an instant.
  [[UNCLEAR: This ability alternates between “Spear of Darkness,” “gun of darkness,” and “Spear of Radiance”; it is unclear if these are naming variants of the same ability or distinct effects.]]

> **Lore:** Along the flight path, it absorbs surrounding light, making the environment shift from bright to dim, dim to pitch-black, then release an intensely condensed white radiance like a miniature sun from the hit direction.

### Yang Yan

> **Lore:** You open your arms halfway, as if embracing the gift of the gods.

- **Cost:** 6 points of **Spirituality**. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=Resource pool]]
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**. [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=Action types]]
- **Targeting and range:** Mysticism attacks all physical defenses in the field except the sun path. [[LINK LATER: Sun Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Exemption in Yang Yan]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=Defense types]]
- **Effect:** A huge pure light ball entwined with countless sacred flames emerges out of thin air, envelops enemies, and quickly melts them—dealing **4d8+5 holy or fire damage**, or half as much damage on failure. [[LINK LATER: Fire Damage | type=mechanic | hint=Damage types]] [[LINK LATER: Holy Damage | type=mechanic | hint=Damage types]]
- **Notes:** It can cause great damage to creatures in the “filthy,” “corrupted,” and “undead” domains, and can even directly destroy them. However, the attack range is large, and it is easy to accidentally injure one’s own side. [[LINK LATER: Undead | type=faction | hint=Creature domain/category]]
  [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether “holy or fire damage” means choose one type or both, and what exactly qualifies for the “sun path” exemption.]]

### Pure White Ray

> **Lore:** Light condenses into a scorching, dazzling ray.

- **Cost:** 3 points of **Spirituality**. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=Resource pool]]
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action** (usable while physically bound). [[LINK LATER: Physically Bound | type=condition | hint=Movement/restraint condition]] [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=Action types]]
- **Targeting and range:** Select 1 target; **Occult** versus **Physical Defense**. [[LINK LATER: Occult | type=mechanic | hint=Skill/check type]] [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=Defense types]]
- **Effect:** Deal **3d6+3 fire or holy damage**.
- **Alternate defense:** This ability can be replaced with resist **Will Defense**, but the check has a **-4 penalty**, and the Spirituality cost increases to **5** points. [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=Defense types]]
  [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether the -4 penalty applies to the attacker’s check or the defender’s resistance when using Will Defense.]]

### Sacred Armor

> **Lore:** A tide of pure golden light gushes from your body, condensing into armor.

- **Cost:** 4 points of **Spirituality**. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=Resource pool]]
- **Use:** 1 **Casting Action**. [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=Action types]]
- **Effect:** You create an armor of light made of pure golden radiance.
  - The armor has **5 Armor** and **3 Damage Reduction** (all damage reduction). [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=mechanic | hint=Defense stat]] [[LINK LATER: Damage Reduction | type=mechanic | hint=Mitigation rules]]
  - For attacks in the undead, fallen, and dark realms, the Armor increases to **10** and Damage Reduction increases to **5**. [[LINK LATER: Undead | type=faction | hint=Creature domain/category]] [[LINK LATER: Fallen | type=faction | hint=Creature domain/category]] [[LINK LATER: Dark Realm | type=location | hint=Realm/domain]]
  - The body touch of the undead, fallen, and dark realms will counteract **2d6 holy damage**, without additional restraint. [[LINK LATER: Holy Damage | type=mechanic | hint=Damage types]]
- **Duration:** Lasts for one encounter. [[LINK LATER: Encounter | type=mechanic | hint=Scene length unit]]
  [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether the increased Armor/DR applies against attacks *from* those domains, attacks *while in* those realms, or attacks of that category.]]

### Sunlight Interpretation

- **Effect:** You can sense what’s happening near the sunlight you are in contact with. [[LINK LATER: Sunlight Interpretation | type=mechanic | hint=Divination-like sense]]
- **Targeting and range:** The range is about a city.
- **Limits:** The perception picture of this ability can be affected by anti-divination. [[LINK LATER: Anti-Divination | type=mechanic | hint=Counter-divination rules]]
