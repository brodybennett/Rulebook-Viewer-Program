# Sequence 6: Notary

## Notary

Notaries specialize in **Notarization**—certifying the authenticity of [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Knowledge | type=term]] (including [[LINK LATER: Potion Formula | type=term]]) and interacting with [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Ability | type=mechanic]] effects as they are cast. They also excel at binding agreements through **Contracts**.

> **Lore:** Notaries are support-focused Beyonders who “certify” truth and enforce binding terms.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main Materials:** Crystal Root of the Tree of the Elders ×1; Tail Feathers of the Kitten ×5
- **Auxiliary Materials:** Radiant Qiling Tree Sap (100 ml); Phnom Penh Sunflower ×1; White Edge Sunflower ×1; Water Fern Juice (drops) ×5

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Agility +1; Inspiration +1; Constitution +2
- **Law:** Included in the category of [[LINK LATER: Rapid Improvement | type=mechanic | hint=advancement category]] up to [[LINK LATER: Mastery | type=mechanic | hint=proficiency tier]].

### Notarization

“Notarize” the authenticity of [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Knowledge | type=term]] or the casting of an [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Ability | type=mechanic]].

- **Cost:** 4 [[LINK LATER: Spirit Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource]]
- **Use:** 1 [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]. Choose **one** option below each time you use Notarization.

#### Valid Notarization (Effectiveness)

You temporarily improve an extraordinary ability you notarize as “effective.”

- **Use requirement:** Speak the keyword **“effective”** in the [[LINK LATER: Language of Mysticism | type=term]]. You may add your own prefix (example: “God said, it is effective!”).
- **Timing / limits:**
  - When you cast an [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Ability | type=mechanic]], you may use this immediately on that casting.
  - Notarization can only be used simultaneously with other abilities and only takes effect once.
- **Effect (choose what applies to the notarized ability):**
  1. **Damage-type ability:** Increase the damage by **+1d10**. The damage type is the same as the original [[LINK LATER: Damage Type | type=mechanic]].
  2. **Effect increase / assistance / change-type ability:** Increase the effect by **half** (rounded down).
  3. **Consumables (e.g., [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Potion | type=item]]):** At the moment they are used, they gain benefit (1) or (2) based on their specific effect.
  4. **Manufacturing / detection abilities:** When identified, the “difficulty of success” increases by **1 level** (10, 15, 20; every 5 increases to 1 level), and “the success level increases from 20 to 25, and from 22 to 25,” excluding “big hits.”  
     [[UNCLEAR: the identification difficulty/success-level parenthetical is internally inconsistent and uses undefined terms (“level,” “success level,” “big hits”).]]

#### Invalid Notarization (Invalidation)

You deem a cast extraordinary ability “invalid,” weakening it or forcibly dispersing it.

- **Use requirement:** Speak the keyword **“invalid”** in the [[LINK LATER: Language of Mysticism | type=term]]. You may add your own prefix (example: “God said, invalid!”).
- **Timing / limits:**
  - When an [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Ability | type=mechanic]] is cast, you use this immediately.
  - Because “valid” and “invalid” must be used at the moment the ability is cast, it:
    - Cannot affect extraordinary abilities cast in advance, and
    - Cannot affect purely physical actions that are not extraordinary abilities.
- **Effect:**
  1. The invalidated ability is regarded as **not used**; it is invalidated, and any materials/actions consumed are **not returned**.
  2. For two consecutive strikes or multiple strikes that consume the same action, all of them are invalidated together.
  3. **Examples (clarification):**
     - You can invalidate a zombie’s ability to condense frost on its fists, but you cannot invalidate the zombie’s act of charging and punching you.
     - You can negate a magma sword condensed by a demon, but you cannot “condense it in advance” and then negate your later physical cutting action.
- **Special:** Extraordinary abilities higher than 1 can only have **half** the effect (rounded up).  
  [[UNCLEAR: “higher than 1” is not defined (ability level? Sequence? tier?), so the scope of this limitation is unclear.]]

#### Notarize Extraordinary Knowledge

You notarize whether **1** piece of [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Knowledge | type=term]] is true.

- **Requirement:** Whatever Beyonder knowledge is notarized, its specific content must be written down. You notarize based on the written content.
- **Effect:**
  1. **Potion formula:** If the formula content is true (not false), you immediately know it is “effective.”
  2. **Extraordinary information:** You can identify whether a piece of extraordinary information is true or false, but the information must exist objectively and include detailed specifics. If it is only a simple clue (“possible” / not objective fact) without complete details, its authenticity cannot be notarized.
     - Example: “You might be able to obtain a potion recipe somewhere” cannot be notarized.
     - If the source specifies which block, where in the house, and which paper contains an effective, authentic potion formula—and it truly exists—then it can be notarized.

### Make a Contract

Make a **Contract**. Once you sign and approve it, higher-Sequence powerhouses must pay a price to violate it (RAW: “Sequence 5 cannot violate it,” and even a “demigod of Sequence 4” pays a big price).  
[[UNCLEAR: the stated binding power vs. Sequence levels conflicts with the later procedure (“not higher than a notary”).]]

There are two forms:

1. **Written Contract:** Use parchment to write the behaviors both parties must perform (e.g., neither party harms the other during a set time; both must help obtain something). Then both parties sign the parchment.
   - The signature may be a code name or pseudonym, but the name must belong to the signer (including their own false identity). This does not affect the mysticism “pointing” still being them.
2. **Oral Contract:** The parties sign on parchment, but the terms are stated orally.

**Procedure (both forms):**

- If one party is unwilling to sign, they may press their palm on the parchment instead; esoteric information is absorbed to lock the signer themself.
- Once completed, both parties feel an invisible bondage and subtle connection.
- A contract may also be one-way (e.g., a confidentiality clause) where only one person signs and is affected.

**Execution:**

1. Once the signature is successful, as long as the target is not higher than a Notary, both parties must fulfill the terms. If not, mysticism enforces compliance, ensuring they cannot violate the terms.
2. Optional: Write the breach price into the contract when signing (what must be paid upon breach). This usually only takes effect in objects with more than 1 personality, and is enforced after a breach.  
   [[UNCLEAR: “objects with more than 1 personality” is undefined.]]
3. Contracts with more than 2 persons generally have no reliable effect and are mostly formalism.

**Default penalty (if no breach price is written):** The party who violates the terms immediately loses all [[LINK LATER: Life Points | type=mechanic | hint=HP]], falls into a [[LINK LATER: Near-Death | type=condition | hint=state]], and this cannot be resisted by a [[LINK LATER: Substitute | type=mechanic | hint=death-avoidance]].
