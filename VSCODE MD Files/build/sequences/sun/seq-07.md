## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Agility +1, Constitution +1, Inspiration +1.
- **Skill/Path Gain:** Your [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=term | hint=core stat/skill]] can be quickly upgraded to [[LINK LATER: Erudition | type=term | hint=core stat/skill]].

### Sun Spells

Your spells and ritual abilities are greatly improved.

- You gain the sun spells below in addition to the spells from the [[LINK LATER: Prayer Stage | type=sequence | hint=sun spell list prerequisite]].
- From now on, you no longer need to adopt a [[LINK LATER: Prayer Posture | type=mechanic | hint=casting requirement]] to cast extraordinary abilities.

### Immune to Fear

- **Cost:** 2 [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource]].
- **Use:** **Swift action** ([[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]).
- **Effect:** You gain immunity to the [[LINK LATER: Fear Condition | type=condition | hint=core conditions]] for 1 [[LINK LATER: Encounter | type=mechanic | hint=timing unit]].
  - Fear states do not arise on you.
  - Existing fear states on you are cleared.
- **Special:** Fear effects “larger than 1 character of you” can still be generated, but their effect is halved (round up).  
  [[UNCLEAR: “larger than 1 character of you” is an unclear size/scale reference.]]

### Fire of Light

- **Cost:** 2 [[LINK LATER: Spirit Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource]].
- **Use:** **Casting action** ([[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]).
- **Targeting and range:** Choose a location/area within 10 meters of you. The area of influence is no more than 10 meters.
- **Effect:** You create a bright, golden illusory fire (an “ocean” of flame due to density).
  - If creatures in the area try to avoid the bright fire, [[LINK LATER: Occult | type=term | hint=attribute/skill]] counters [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]] and ignores dexterity and evasion.
  - Any [[LINK LATER: Creature Traits | type=rule | hint=Dark, Corrupted, Undead]] creatures that touch the fire suffer **2d6 sacred damage** and **1d6 fire damage**, and gain the [[LINK LATER: Restraint | type=mechanic | hint=holy counter/extra damage mechanic]] effect.
  - This golden illusory flame can exist underwater.
  - The flames only spread on things related to darkness, corruption, and undeath, and can be extinguished at any time according to your will.
- **Limits:** The fire of light has no effect on normal creatures and objects, and cannot ignite normal objects.
- **Scaling:** [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=same pathway]]: The influence range of bright fire increases to 25 meters.

### Cleansing Slash

- **Cost:** 1 [[LINK LATER: Spirit Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource]].
- **Use:** **Swift action** ([[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]). Can be attached to weapons.
- **Effect:** The next damage you deal gains restrained damage.
  - Regardless of the original damage type, only the additional restrained damage is considered holy damage.
  - This can be stacked with [[LINK LATER: Purifying Bullets | type=mechanic | hint=holy ammunition ability]], but not with other holy abilities that already counter damage.
- **Example:** A revolver deals 1d8+5 physical damage.
  - If it attacks a dark creature: 1d8+5 physical damage + 1d6 holy damage.
  - If it is fallen: 2d6 holy damage.
  - If it is undead: 3d6 holy damage.
- **Limits:** Only affects the next damage instance.
  - To apply it to two hits, apply it twice.
  - To apply it to six bullets, apply it six times.
  - You can attack while applying it.
- **Scaling:** [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=same pathway]]: Increase restraint damage from cleansing slash by 1d6.

### Sacred Oath

- **Cost:** 2 [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource]].
- **Use:** **Swift action** ([[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]).
- **Requirement:** Read the corresponding ancient [[LINK LATER: Hermetic Words | type=term | hint=incantation]] in the [[LINK LATER: Language of Occultism | type=term | hint=ritual language]].
- **Effect:** Choose one effect; only one can be active at a time. Duration: 2 rounds.
  1. **"Power!":** Your power +2. Cannot be superimposed with the power brought by [[LINK LATER: Singing | type=mechanic | hint=buff source]].
  2. **"Agility!":** Your agility +2. Cannot be superimposed with the agility brought by [[LINK LATER: Singing | type=mechanic | hint=buff source]].
  3. **"Flame!":** All your next damage adds 1d6 fire damage for 2 rounds. Free/attack/casting/full rounds that already have fire damage cannot increase this benefit.
  4. **"Holy!":** All your next damage adds 1d6 holy damage for 2 rounds (no restraint effect). Free/attack/casting/full rounds that already have holy damage cannot increase this benefit.
- **Limits:** Once selected, the effect cannot be switched before it ends.
- **Scaling:** [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=same pathway]]: You can apply sacred oath to other creatures within sight. Attribute increases become +3, and damage increases become 2d6.

### Sun Halo

- **Cost:** 2 [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource]].
- **Use:** **Casting action** ([[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]).
- **Targeting and range:** Choose friendly units within 20 meters of you as the center.
- **Effect:**
  1. Anyone you consider a friend is affected; you can precisely control the halo to avoid specific targets.
  2. Effects of fear, cold, curse, poison, darkness, corruption, and undead in their bodies are cleared. Dark, corrupted, and undead creatures immediately suffer sacred damage equal to the restrained damage, and continue losing it each round if they do not leave the range.
  3. If using this ability to attack and the opponent intends to dodge, [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=term | hint=core stat/skill]] counters physical defense, ignoring agility and dodge.
- **Scaling:** [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=same pathway]]: Affects friendly units within 50 meters and gains a “qualitatively changed” version of the purification aura.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The “qualitatively changed version” is referenced but not defined here.]]

### Make Holy Water

- **Cost:** 4 [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource]].
- **Use:** **Full-round action** ([[LINK LATER: Full-Round Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]).
- **Effect:** Create one bottle of [[LINK LATER: Sun Holy Water | type=item | hint=created consumable]] by saying “sun” in the mystical language.
  - You must prepare a container in advance to carry it, otherwise it spills onto the ground.
- **Reference:** See [[LINK LATER: Holy Water Prayer | type=rule | hint=effects of holy water]] for details.
- **Scaling:** [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=same pathway]]: Use becomes 1 casting action instead.

### Sun Ritual

- **Effect:** From now on, when you perform ritual magic in the sun domain, occult identification automatically succeeds by default.
- **Scaling:** [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=same pathway]]: As long as you do not believe in hostile gods, you can still receive a stable response even if you are not a believer in the sun.
- **Limits:** This effect is brought by a potion, is an improvement during the [[LINK LATER: Sequence 8 | type=sequence | hint=earlier stage]] period, and cannot be recorded or stolen.

### Body of the Sun

- **Effect:** You obtain a special [[LINK LATER: Sun Path | type=pathway | hint=unique path gained here]], making it difficult to be possessed or polluted by evil spirit-like monsters.
  - You gain 5 points of resistance to curse, cold, and poison; this cannot be superimposed with [[LINK LATER: Holy Water | type=item | hint=resistance overlap]].
  - Only [[LINK LATER: Wraith Shadow | type=term | hint=possessing entity]] higher than your sequence level (or “1 character” higher) can possess you.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “1 character” is an unclear scaling reference.]]
- **When a wraith shadow attempts possession:**
  - It immediately senses the breath of the sun.
  - If it is not higher than your sequence level: if it forcibly possesses you, it fails and suffers sacred damage equal to the restrained damage.
  - If a higher-level wraith shadow successfully possesses you: it suffers 1d6 holy damage each round (no additional restraint effect) and does not break away from the possession.
- **Scaling:**
  - [[LINK LATER: Sequence 6 | type=sequence | hint=same pathway]]: Wraith shadows that are not higher than “1 person of you” also suffer restraint damage when they try to possess you, and immediately leave the possessed state.
  - [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=same pathway]]: Resistance to curse, cold, and poison becomes 10 points.
