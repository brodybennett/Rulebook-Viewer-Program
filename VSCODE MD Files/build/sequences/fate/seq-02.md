# Wheel of Fortune Pathway: Sequence 2

## Soothsayer

- This **Sequence** is an [[LINK LATER: Angel | type=term | hint=rank/tier of Beyonders]] of the [[LINK LATER: Wheel of Fortune Pathway | type=pathway]].
- See also: [[LINK LATER: Wheel of Fortune Pathway | type=pathway]]

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Find an event with the lowest probability of occurrence in the [[LINK LATER: Torrent of Fate | type=term | hint=metaphysical flow of fate]], and then use your own destiny and the ability of [[LINK LATER: Good Luck | type=condition | hint=luck boon]] or [[LINK LATER: Bad Luck | type=condition | hint=luck bane]] to make this event almost inevitable, and an event that has successfully happened.

> **GM Note:** The RAW labels this as an “unofficial ceremony”.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** **Inspiration** +6; your [[LINK LATER: Occult Science | type=skill | hint=“occult science” level]] goes up by one level; one skill of your choice goes up by one level.

### Prophet

- **Use:** Three times per day, you can make an **Inspiration** check, judging what an action in the future (rather than the present) will produce.
- **Effect:** You spy on the secrets of future destiny. This can accurately see part of the picture clearly and accurately, and you can even spy on the [[LINK LATER: King of Angels | type=term | hint=high-level beings]] and [[LINK LATER: Uniqueness | type=term | hint=high-level trait/authority]] to a certain extent.
- **Difficulty Value 20:** The **GM** tells you whether the outcome of this action is good or bad.
- **Difficulty Value 25:** You get a clearer picture.
- **Difficulty Value 30:** You almost figure out what’s going on.
- **Big success:** You figure out how to act in your best interest.
- **Big failure:** You accidentally see something you shouldn’t.
- **Limits:** Every time a **Sequence** or character is promoted: the number of prophetic predictions +2, but **Sequence** 0 will be promoted to ten times. [[UNCLEAR: “ten times” is not clearly defined (flat 10 uses vs a multiplier, and what it modifies).]]
- **Aftereffects:** Prying on high-level persons may be detected and cause corresponding reactions.
- **Extra:** You increase or decrease the chance that the scene you spy on will or won’t happen. For the picture you see, you can control the content in the picture, and you can apply the ability of your [[LINK LATER: Destiny Domain | type=term | hint=domain/authority]] to the future: endow bad luck or good luck, or reverse good luck and bad luck, so that this thing will happen—or will not happen—when it appears. So you can pretty much manipulate the future orientation, pointing the future where you want it before it happens.

### River of Fate

- **Effect:** Your connection to the [[LINK LATER: River of Fate | type=location | hint=metaphysical river tied to destiny]] deepens so much that you can perceive things connected to your destiny.
- **Requirements:** From now on, anything you make with your own hands (such as an origami crane, or a doll you weave yourself): when they change, you can sense them now, unless blocked by some kind of [[LINK LATER: Seal | type=mechanic | hint=effect that blocks sensing]]. These things must have a strong connection with you (i.e., created by you). You can sense a paper crane folded by you yourself, but it is difficult for you to sense an item that is only given luck by you. An object that you simply touched cannot be used for this ability.
- **Sensing details:** If something was written on such an item, you can know the content. If it is destroyed, you can feel obvious changes.
- **Special:** When these contents change, you can enter the dream of the person who caused the change, and remotely exert influence on the person who caused the change. This is limited to the influence of the dream for the time being (for example, you can let them see something, or make them very unlucky after sleeping), or you can use the connection between them and you to lock the other party with prophecy.
- **Limits:** If the opponent is lower than you, even if they can’t dream, you can make them dream, but they must sleep first, and you can’t force them to enter the dream state by means similar to the nightmare before sleep.
- **Aftereffects:** If you randomly give these things that are directly related to your destiny, it may cause you to be reversely locked by other people at the same level.
- **At Sequence 1:** You can let some power flow along the trail of fate. When such a thing is burned, shredded, or damaged enough to destroy it, you can instantly project power there, and use your prowess there once, only once.
