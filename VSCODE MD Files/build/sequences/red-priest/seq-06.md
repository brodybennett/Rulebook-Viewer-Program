# Sequence 6: Conspirator

> **Lore:** A Conspirator becomes sharper-minded and more persuasive, with strong communication and information-gathering skills.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:** compound eyes of the hunting black spider; brain of the sphinx.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** strength +1, constitution +1, agility +1, inspiration +2.
- detection, deception, persuasion, and speaking skills can quickly grow to a master.
- Every time you target a target stronger than you, you will bring him significant damage through conspiracy. The loss of is also regarded as 1 growth.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “The loss of” does not specify what is being lost (HP, resources, etc.), so the growth trigger cannot be precisely interpreted.]]

### Insight

> **Lore:** This is the benefit of the potion: your intelligence, your ability to make up reasons, and your ability to persuade others are enhanced.

1. Scouting, deception, persuasion, and speaking skill identification are **+2 favorable** by default, and ideas will be formed when you open your mouth.
2. If there is something wrong with what someone said to you, and you want to turn black and white, confuse concepts, and disturb your thinking:
   - You can directly make a **Difficulty Value** 20 detection and appraisal to detect the error, and know which sentence is wrong.
3. If you find some events that are inconsistent in details, you can also enjoy the effect of (2).

- (But you can't directly guess the other party's intentions and why they did this.)

### Conspiracy

You are good at plotting conspiracies. This is in the normal category of deception, and it only has supernatural power in subtleties. Therefore, the deceived will not be passively aware of being deceived; they must actively think and analyze to find the problem.

- This ability can be used in two ways:

#### Misleading

You must convey information in some way (such as letters/words) to make the other party believe your words.

- **Cost:** 1 **Swift Action**, consuming 1 **Sanity Point**.
- **Use:** Create a message by word/letter.
- **Effect (message requirements):**
  - The information can be a lie/half-truth.
  - It must be consistent and relevant to what others already know.
  - It must be plausible enough for the target to believe it to be true.

> **GM Note:** Example (from RAW): a killer disguises themself as a young girl to infiltrate a dinner party; you tell the suspicious host the killer is an underage daughter of a family, with “evidence,” to resolve suspicion.

- **Adjudication and detection:**
  - The misled person will have to believe the information.
  - Whether a misleading is reasonable or not is up to the **GM** to decide.
  - The **GM** should give the misleading object various “safety filters” when they are convinced of it.
  - **Active examination:** If the misled person actively applies and chooses to conduct a **Difficulty Value** 20 detection/inspiration/psychological guidance appraisal on this information, they can detect something is wrong.
    - The **GM** must let the misled person actively examine it to detect something is wrong.
  - **Contradicting clues:** When finding clues that contradict the misleading content, they can passively carry out the corresponding identification to detect it.
  - **At the moment of being misled:** Psychological hints may allow the misled person to use the corresponding identification to find something wrong at the moment of being misled.
  - Other Conspirators enjoy the benefits of immediate detection by default.
  - Hostile/vigilant creatures: if the content involves important things, they can immediately conduct a detection appraisal, and the opponent’s appraisal **+2 is beneficial**, so it cannot be used in battle.
  - Because it only has supernatural effects in subtle places, the antivirus of the original work cannot detect this impact.

#### Planning

You plan a conspiracy and start to implement the plan.

- **Cost:** This usage does not need to consume actions and [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource mentioned as normally spendable]] as long as you give suitable content.
- **Use:** For a certain future encounter, designate a detailed plan and give it to your **GM** for review.
- **Limits (plan quality):**
  - The plan should not be too general.
  - Example of an unqualified plan: content is only “win” or “escape” without a specific description of how to win or escape.
- **Effect:** As long as your plan is complete, when this encounter occurs, as long as the development of the situation is still within your plan, you get an additional **+4 bonus** on all skill and attribute checks.
- **Fear empowerment:** If you find the target and tell him your plan when you face him—letting him know how small and helpless he is being calculated—then as long as the situation is still in your plan, he will continue to be empowered state of fear.
- **Multiple plans:** You don’t have to make only one plan. You can also make plan B and plan C. If plan A goes wrong and the development after the mistake is in plan B or plan C, then the benefits can still be obtained.
- **Impromptu plans:** It is feasible to make an impromptu plan to regain benefits, but generally you will not have that much time. If the **GM** allows, then maybe you can use enough time outside the group to submit your impromptu plan.
