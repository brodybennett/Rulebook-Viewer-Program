# Sequence 8: Provocateur

> **Lore:** Good at provoking others with casual words and actions.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Dexterity +1, Constitution +1, Inspiration +2.
- Deception / Speaking / Persuasion are included in the growth range of your Sequence 9 skills [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9 | type=sequence | hint=skill growth rules referenced by Sequence 9]], up to proficiency.
- Every time you succeed in making an intelligent creature stronger than you complete for the first time due to provocation, losing sanity counts as 1 growth. [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term | hint=losing sanity referenced as growth]]
[[UNCLEAR: The trigger sentence for gaining “growth” is grammatically unclear (“stronger than you complete”), so the exact condition for when “growth” is gained cannot be resolved from this excerpt.]]

### Provoke

- **Use:** You provoke a creature. You must use verbal roleplay (to provoke or taunt), except where the rules explicitly say words are not required.

This ability is divided into three situations.

#### Situation 1: Complete Strangers / Newly Met Friends

1. **Action:** 1 casting action. [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
2. **Cost:** 2 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource points spent to activate abilities]]
3. **Check:** Inspiration -4 vs the target’s Will Defense. [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute/check used for Provoke]] [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense used against Inspiration]]
4. **Effect:**
   1. The target’s next action involving attacks and negative effects (e.g., shooting, fighting, using extraordinary abilities) must target you, unless you have fallen into a state of death, fainting, or helplessness. [[LINK LATER: Death | type=condition | hint=state that ends forced targeting]] [[LINK LATER: Fainting | type=condition | hint=state that ends forced targeting]] [[LINK LATER: Helplessness | type=condition | hint=state that ends forced targeting]]
5. **Special Targets (beasts/monsters/out-of-control persons):**
   1. You can only use the first level of provocation against them.
   2. No words are required; more in-depth provocations are invalid for these targets (this is the use of actively exuding disgusting feelings).
   3. For intelligent beings, this unspoken feeling of disgust is not provocative, but it does make you more conspicuous.
   4. For beasts and insane targets only: if you have already dealt two critical blows to it, the provocation automatically counts as a second tier of provocation, not a first tier. [[LINK LATER: Critical Blow | type=mechanic | hint=critical hit/critical strike rule]]

#### Situation 2: Target Has Some Understanding of the Provocateur

1. **Action:** 1 casting action.
2. **Cost:** 2 spirituality points.
3. **Check:** Inspiration vs the target’s Will Defense.
4. **Effect:** On the basis of the effect of only one side, the target additionally falls into a state of anger (Rage state).
[[UNCLEAR: “On the basis of the effect of only one side” references a choice or prior effect not defined in this excerpt, so what it modifies cannot be resolved here.]]

- If the provoked object successfully causes an effective damage to the source of anger, the anger state will end.

**Rage state:**
- You suffer a -4 penalty on skill checks.
- Move actions can only move toward the source of rage. [[LINK LATER: Move Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- You must attack the source of rage or blockers first, until you regain your composure or the source of rage dies, faints, or falls into a helpless state.

1. If the remaining HP of the recipient of the anger state ≤ the total HP divided by 4 (rounded up), the subject will only suffer from the anger state, and the anger state does not have the effect of restricting actions. [[LINK LATER: HP | type=term | hint=health/hit points]]
2. Different from normal anger: if the provocateur does not cause 1 damage, or use 1 Will/Psychological Guidance appraisal to identify the result of provoking against the provocateur at the beginning of each round, the anger cannot be relieved. [[LINK LATER: Will (Attribute/Check) | type=term | hint=used in Will/Psychological Guidance appraisal]] [[LINK LATER: Psychological Guidance | type=term | hint=skill/check used to resolve provocation]]
[[UNCLEAR: The clause “if the provocateur does not cause 1 damage” is unclear about who must deal damage to whom, and how this interacts with relieving Rage.]]
3. Half meditation can be changed to (1) effect, and full meditation will be halved on this basis. [[LINK LATER: Meditation | type=mechanic | hint=half meditation and full meditation rules]]
[[UNCLEAR: “Half meditation can be changed to (1) effect” does not specify what is being changed or how full meditation is “halved,” so the exact mechanical operation cannot be resolved from this excerpt.]]
4. Others can also use 1 Psychological Guidance / Social Identification to help resolve the provocation, against the result of the inspirational identification when the provocateur provokes. [[LINK LATER: Social Identification | type=term | hint=skill/check used to resolve provocation]]
5. For 1 round, a target that has made a successful Mental Channel check cannot be provoked. [[LINK LATER: Mental Channel | type=mechanic | hint=check that can prevent being provoked for 1 round]]

#### Defining “Some Understanding” vs “Full Knowledge”

1. **Some understanding** is satisfied if the provocateur meets **either** condition:
   1. Know one of the titles of the provocateur (by name or pronoun), and know the general life experience of the provocation target (roughly what kind of person they are). This information can be obtained through inquiring. (Experience must be real; mere speculation is not accurate unless it is correct.)
   2. Know the weakness of the object being provoked. This must be accurate, true, and still valid, including shady personal hobbies that make people laugh, as long as the target really cares about these.
2. If **both** conditions are met, the provocateur is considered to have **full knowledge** of the target.

#### Situation 3: Target Fully Known to the Provocateur

- **Action:** 1 swift action. [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Cost:** 2 spirituality points.
- **Check:** The provocation is successful by default.
- **Roleplay:** You use the other party’s name or weakness in roleplay words.
- **Effect:**
  1. All actions involving attacks and negative effects must take you as the top priority, unless you fall into a state of death, fainting, or helplessness, or the remaining HP of the provoked object ≤ the total HP divided by 4 (rounded up).
  2. The provoked person continues to be in a state of anger. If the provoked creature is provoked when the remaining HP ≤ total HP divided by 4 (rounded up), it will only suffer the effect of anger, but this state of anger does not contain any restrictions on actions.
  3. If someone obstructs the person being provoked, then only when the obstruction is being executed, the obstructer is also included in the attackable range.
  4. At the beginning of each round, the provoked person can still use the Will/Psychological Guidance appraisal to try to remove the provocation (anger) effect independently, but the difficulty of the confrontation is changed to the following; if the confrontation is successful once, the effect is only halved, it will not be forced to move, and it can be removed after two times.
  [[UNCLEAR: The text says the confrontation difficulty “is changed to the following,” but no “following” difficulty is provided within this excerpt.]]
  5. Half-meditation is no longer effective. Full meditation is regarded as (4), but you must meditate twice in a row, and the provocateur in the middle can provoke again.

- This rage state doesn't end just by doing damage to you simply successfully.

#### Removal of Anger by Others

- **Action:** 1 Psychological Guidance / Social Identification.
- **Effect:** In this state, provocation (including anger state) can still be lifted, but the identification difficulty of Psychological Guidance must exceed “the Will Defense of the provoked object + the Inspiration of the provocateur.”
- If the Mental Guidance check succeeds, the provocateur cannot provoke the target again for 1 round. [[LINK LATER: Mental Guidance | type=mechanic | hint=check referenced when others remove anger]]
