# Sequence 3: War Bishop

## War Bishop

> **Lore:** High-level power belongs to war, and war is the art of gathering crowds. Only a War Bishop can fully bring an army’s strengths to bear.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Lead an army completely loyal to you, achieve a tacit understanding of oneness with your comrades, and achieve a remarkable victory in a grand campaign.
  > **GM Note:** The RAW labels this as an “unofficial ceremony,” with no additional mechanical effect stated.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Agility +2, Strength +2, Constitution +1.
- Choose one [[LINK LATER: Skills | type=mechanic | hint=skill levels/ranks]] to increase by 1 level.

### Spiritual Communication

- **Cost:** 12 points of **[[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource pool spent to use abilities]]**.
- **Use:** A spell-casting action.
- **Targeting and range:** Choose an army or team within line of sight, within a radius of 1 kilometer.
- **Effect:** You can communicate silently with the chosen group and “form a whole,” gathering their strength and passing your strength to them. While you are a **[[LINK LATER: Whole | type=condition | hint=state created by Spiritual Communication]]**, apply the following benefits:

1. You can communicate with each other without any action, and when you are a whole, the skills of all members are +5.
2. Team members who are weaker than you can use your skills and attribute points for attributes and skills, without affecting **[[LINK LATER: HP | type=mechanic | hint=health/HP maximum]]** or **[[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource pool maximum]]** values.
3. For every 10 people, the HP limit of all members of the team is +2 (up to 40).
4. For every 10 people, the Spirituality limit of all members of the team is +2 (up to 40).
5. When the number of troops reaches 200, the skill **[[LINK LATER: Hunting Mark | type=mechanic | hint=skill granted to everyone at 200 troops]]** is considered to be given to everyone, and the increase of the **[[LINK LATER: Maximum Success Range | type=mechanic | hint=range-increase effect referenced by Hunting Mark]]** is regarded as a normal state.  
   [[UNCLEAR: “Maximum success range” and what it means for its increase to be a “normal state” are not defined here.]]

- **Extra (alternate use):** You can choose another way to use this skill, which no longer has a hard requirement on the number of people.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The “hard requirement on the number of people” is not stated for the normal use, so it is unclear what requirement is being removed.]]

1. Choose two attributes to give to all other teammates. (Teammates whose attribute is higher than this are not subject to the bonus.)
2. The upper limit of HP of everyone in your team is increased by 15.
3. Choose one of your “trained and above” skills to give to all teammates, and they can use those skills as normal. [[LINK LATER: Trained Skill | type=term | hint=skill rank threshold “trained and above”]]
4. Your teammates’ Spirituality can be paid by you.
5. You can communicate with each other without any action, and when you are a whole, the skills of all members are +2.

- **Duration:** 2 hours.
- **Resident effect (non-combat):** In the **[[LINK LATER: Non-Combat State | type=condition | hint=not in combat]]**, you can choose one of the above additional contents as a **[[LINK LATER: Resident Effect | type=mechanic | hint=persistent out-of-combat benefit]]**, and switch every half a day.  
  The bonus in battle and the resident bonus are calculated separately (i.e., bonus selections for combat do not affect benefits already selected outside of combat).
  [[UNCLEAR: “Above additional contents” most naturally refers to the Extra list, but the reference is not explicit.]]
