# Sequence 1: Emperor of Knowledge

## Emperor of Knowledge

- (Reference only.)
- Can impart substantial power to abstract knowledge.
- It can condense complex and illusory symbols one after another in the eyes, pouring a lot of complicated and useless knowledge into the target's mind, bursting its head.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Find the source of knowledge in the flood of information. *(Unofficial ceremony.)*

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** inspiration +2, education +2.
- You choose two skills to upgrade to **master**. [[LINK LATER: master | type=mechanic | hint=skill rank/upgrade tier]]

### Empowering Knowledge

- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: spirituality points | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent to activate abilities]]
- **Use:** A spell-casting action.
- **Effect:** You put written knowledge into substance. You write down secret knowledge related to the extraordinary (such as the potion formula). After that, this knowledge will get part of your personality, and it will be regarded as the extraordinary existence of [[LINK LATER: this Pathway | type=pathway | hint=the Pathway containing Emperor of Knowledge]] and will be regarded as the real meaning with extraordinary power. [[UNCLEAR: The RAW sentence about “real meaning” is grammatically unclear; interpreted as the written knowledge becoming an extraordinary existence with power.]]
- **Limits:** The degree to which you can use it depends on your knowledge reserve, with effects based on what is written:
  - Potion formula: It can only cause the effect of the [[LINK LATER: Law of Convergence of Extraordinary characteristics | type=mechanic | hint=Pathway-specific convergence effect]] of this Pathway, and provide a +2 [[LINK LATER: identification bonus | type=mechanic | hint=bonus applied when identifying beings/items]] for the existence of this Pathway.
  - Mythological knowledge of the secret path: You can use this written item to restore part of the power of its content. The more detailed, hidden, and real the content, the stronger the effect.
  - Almost no one knows about all the extraordinary knowledge about this path: it may be as thick as a [[LINK LATER: Codex | type=item | hint=example of a very large knowledge-tome item]], but you can use it to fully use the power of the corresponding [[LINK LATER: Sequence 2 | type=sequence | hint=the “Sequence 2 level” referenced here]] level, which is essentially your realistic restoration of the content of knowledge. Crafting such an item requires a separate calculation of spirituality, requiring at least 12 spirituality points. [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear how the “separate calculation” relates to the 3-point cost; text preserved as written.]]
  - If others want to use these items, it is necessary to be able to understand and read the corresponding content, otherwise its own effect will be greatly reduced.
    - Example: the last one is like the Codex. Users may have to read it for a year, read it repeatedly from various angles, and truly understand all the contents in it. They can even conceive accurate ideas in their minds without this book. The screen can only be used. [[UNCLEAR: “The screen can only be used” appears mistranslated; kept verbatim.]] Otherwise, at most it will bring only a small amount of ability and personality improvement.

### Knowledge into Power

- **Effect:** You can directly restore the hidden mythological scene at that time through the known knowledge. The content inside is lifelike. The more secret, detailed, and real the knowledge, the better the restoration effect; otherwise it may be just useless the illusion of the table. The specific reference standard is the same as above.
- **Limits:** Legends and myths that can be seen everywhere cannot achieve the desired effect, because they are more or less seriously embellished and cannot be used as a feasible knowledge.
> **GM Note:** Usually, at this stage, the Emperor of Knowledge has personally explored some of the secrets of history, and restored various details and truths of the time.
