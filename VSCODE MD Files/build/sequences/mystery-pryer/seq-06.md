# Sequence 6: Scroll Professor

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute score | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Attribute Gain]] +2
- Your [[LINK LATER: Occult | type=term | hint=skill/proficiency | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Attribute Gain]] / [[LINK LATER: Occult Language | type=term | hint=skill/proficiency | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Attribute Gain]] can be quickly raised to [[LINK LATER: Erudition | type=term | hint=rank/threshold for Occult/Occult Language | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Attribute Gain]].
  [[UNCLEAR: The term "erudition" is not defined here as a rank/value for Occult or Occult Language.]]

### Scroll Scribe

You can transcribe magic into scrolls.

- **Cost:** 1 piece of [[LINK LATER: Parchment | type=item | hint=consumed on transcription | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]] (consumed).
- **Use:** Takes 1 minute to conduct a [[LINK LATER: Mystery | type=mechanic | hint=check/action with a difficulty | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]] with a difficulty of 25; if the [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=success condition during transcription | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]] is successful, the spell is successfully copied into the scroll.
- **Effect:**
  1. Spells transcribed are limited to the effects of:
     - [[LINK LATER: Voyeur Spells | type=term | hint=spell category | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]]
     - [[LINK LATER: Timber Witchcraft | type=term | hint=spell category | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]]
     - [[LINK LATER: Ritual Magic | type=term | hint=spell category | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]]
  2. Transcribed spells may have already been strengthened by [[LINK LATER: Knowledge Enhancement | type=mechanic | hint=spell strengthening source | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]]. Casting a spell that has been strengthened by Knowledge Enhancement through the scroll requires only one [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=spell-casting action | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]].
  3. **Scroll** ≠ **Record**: because the scroll can transcribe the effects of Ritual Magic, you can pray to the corresponding gods to obtain extraordinary abilities through Ritual Magic. This process is like a spell, and you cannot transcribe the ability of attack actions.
     - [[LINK LATER: Record | type=term | hint=distinct from scroll | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]]
     - [[LINK LATER: Attack Actions | type=mechanic | hint=non-transcribable action type | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe]]

#### Using a Scroll

1. One spell-casting action: consume 3 [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Points | type=term | hint=resource spent to activate scroll | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe > Using a Scroll]], read the spell, and activate the scroll to release the magic inside. No roll is required; it can be used directly according to the original ability. This differs from a spell and can be roughly understood as a high-level spell.
2. The shelf life of the scroll is 7 days; the effect will not be reduced.
   > **GM Note:** Usually, there will be no [[LINK LATER: Demigod Materials | type=item | hint=rare crafting materials | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe > Using a Scroll]] to make [[LINK LATER: Demigod Scrolls | type=item | hint=scroll tier | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Scribe > Using a Scroll]].

### Scroll Improvement

For an ability copied into a scroll by you that has not obtained Knowledge Enhancement (but comes from other means), you can apply Knowledge Enhancement to it within the scroll.

- **Use:** The moment you craft another [[LINK LATER: Pathway | type=term | hint=character advancement path | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Improvement]] ability scroll, choose one benefit to add to the embedded ability.
- **Effect (choose one):**
  - **Originally required continuous maintenance:** The scroll cannot continuously maintain the effect. Instead, make an **Occult check** against **Will defense**; on success, apply the corresponding effect for **1d2 rounds**.
    - [[LINK LATER: Occult Check | type=mechanic | hint=check type used here | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Improvement]]
    - [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=term | hint=defense target for mental effects | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Improvement]]
    - > **GM Note:** Originally, mental abilities are against Will defense; physical damage abilities are against [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=term | hint=defense target for physical effects | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Improvement]]; and those affected by poisons and diseases are against Physical Defense.
    - > **GM Note:** Example: [[LINK LATER: Requiem of the Dark Night | type=sequence | hint=Dark Night Pathway Sequence 6 ability | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Improvement]] requires continuous spellcasting maintenance, but an instant-cast [[LINK LATER: Mystic Scroll | type=item | hint=instant-cast scroll | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Improvement]] cannot do this.
  - **Originally single-target:** Change it to a group effect, affecting all targets within a radius of **10 meters**.
  - **Originally damage-type:** Increase the original damage by **1d10**; the damage type remains the same as the original ability.
  - **Originally manufacturing:** Gain a **+4 bonus** on checks when manufacturing the corresponding product.
  - **Originally, identification was not an ability of occultism:** When you cast the corresponding ability, it is changed to occult identification.

- **At higher Sequences:**
  - **Sequence 5:** You can choose two improved effects instead; the original scroll needs to be re-transcribed.
  - **Sequence 4:** You can select three improved effects instead; the original scroll needs to be re-transcribed.

> **GM Note:** Although the above scroll improvements may seem to make the Scroll Professor more powerful than the original caster, it is not entirely true. For example, the fireball created in the [[LINK LATER: Red Priest | type=pathway | hint=Pathway referenced in example | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Improvement]]’s [[LINK LATER: Manipulation of Flames | type=mechanic | hint=ability referenced in example | where_used=Sequence 6: Scroll Professor > Extraordinary Abilities > Scroll Improvement]] is **2d10** initial damage, which requires continuous compression of the flames to achieve **4d10** or even **5d10** damage.
>
> The Scroll Professor’s scroll can only do one of the effects of creating fireballs or compressing flames at a time. In other words, compared to a Red Priest, the Scroll Professor can only cause **2d10** damage in the end (there may be an additional bonus of **1d10**), while the Red Priest can cause **4d10** or even **5d10** damage.
