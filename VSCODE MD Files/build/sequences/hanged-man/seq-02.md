# Sequence 2: Profane Presbyter

## Profane Presbyter

- You can intercept part of another party’s answer, or expand its ambiguity, to create a speech-like effect.
- Every word adds layers and power when speaking who you are.
- You can intercept a few words in an opponent’s speech and make them reality, creating incredible effects such as [[LINK LATER: Imprisonment | type=condition | hint=isolated from the outside world]], [[LINK LATER: Degeneration | type=condition | hint=effect mentioned as possible outcome]], and [[LINK LATER: Splitting | type=condition | hint=effect mentioned as possible outcome]].

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** To completely degenerate a rational creature with [[LINK LATER: Divinity | type=term | hint=trait referenced in ritual]], and through the means of turning their previous words into reality, completely becoming a walking dead wandering in the power of regret and shadow.

> **GM Note:** The source labels this as an “unofficial ceremony.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +1, Dexterity +1, Inspiration +1.

### Evil Words

- **Effect:** The words you speak distort reality.

#### Self-Blessing

- **Use:** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Cost:** 1 point of [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent to activate abilities]]
- **Effect:** You can use this power to bless yourself; it takes subtlety to influence others.

- Example:
  - You claim to be a king of angels, which gives you +1 personality (but not as much as the real king of angels).
  - At the same time, you gain +4 on all skill checks for one [[LINK LATER: Encounter | type=mechanic | hint=scene/encounter duration]].
  - [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether the listed bonuses are fixed effects of this ability or only illustrative example values.]]

#### Word Interception (Additional)

- **Use:** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Cost:** 5 [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent to activate abilities]] points
- **Effect:** You intercept the other person’s words, take them out of context, and make them reality.

- Example:
  - A person said: “I don’t know where [[LINK LATER: Backlund | type=location | hint=place referenced in example]] is.”
  - As a free action, you distort their words to read: “I don’t know where.”
  - Result: They immediately obtain the effect of [[LINK LATER: Imprisonment | type=condition | hint=isolated from the outside world]]—they are isolated from the outside world. This does not affect their movements, but they are unable to leave this place within an encounter.
