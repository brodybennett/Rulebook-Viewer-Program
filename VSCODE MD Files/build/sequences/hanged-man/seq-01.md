# Hanged Man Pathway: Sequence 1

## Dark Angel

> **Lore:** The Archangel of the Hanged Man Pathway.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Using the power of corruption, but in a sacred form, the people of a city can be baptized and blessed accordingly. *(Unofficial ceremony.)*

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1, Inspiration +1, Charisma +1, Will +1

### Dark Angel

- **Use:** As a **free action**, intertwined virtual black wings appear behind you (like 9-winged angels), covering most of your body.
- **Effect: Void Black Wings**
  - While the wings exist:
    - The wings are considered to have Health equal to yours *(not counting **extra life**).* [[LINK LATER: Extra Life | type=mechanic | hint=temporary life buffer distinct from Health]]
    - The wings have **10 unconditional damage reduction**.
    - When you take damage, the wings take damage first.
    - You gain a **+8 check bonus** to all skills.
    - You gain **+3 to all your attributes**.
    - You can avoid the influence of the [[LINK LATER: Darkness Realm | type=location | hint=realm/zone effect]].
  - When the wings bear the damage instead of you, it manifests as a dark, viscous, corrupted “ocean” that swallows the enemy’s attack and disappears invisible.
- **Aftereffects: Wing Recovery**
  - When the wings disappear and dissipate, you must either:
    - Go through an [[LINK LATER: Encounter Time | type=mechanic | hint=encounter-scale time interval]] to reorganize, **or**
    - Make a d20 appraisal at the end of each round.
  - While reorganizing/recovering, you cannot be [[LINK LATER: Transported | type=mechanic | hint=teleportation/forced movement/transport effect]].
  - If the d20 roll is **20, 19, or 18**, your wings recover.
- **Special: Winged State**
  - While in **Winged state**, there is no longer a limit to the number of abilities you can [[LINK LATER: Graze On Abilities | type=mechanic | hint=ability acquisition/assimilation mechanic]].
- **Special: Sea of Wings (Curse)**
  - You can use a **casting action** to select a target or an area, and let the sea of wings gradually cover the surface of others. “Fallen creatures.”
    [[UNCLEAR: The target/area procedure and the meaning/effect of “Fallen creatures” are not defined in this section.]]
    - [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type used for this effect]]
    - [[LINK LATER: Fallen | type=condition | hint=“Fallen creature” state referenced here]]
  - If a creature continues to suffer from this effect:
    - After **three rounds**, the opponent begins to transform into a part of the “ocean,” and the opponent’s remaining life becomes the **extra life** of your wings.
    - It takes **five rounds** for an angel-level existence to do so.
    - If the gods and below do not make effective countermeasures after the opponent’s turn, they immediately become part of your wings.
  - This is considered a [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=condition | hint=curse category for effects]] that can be marginally dispelled by angel-level abilities or Sun Pathway demigod-level abilities.
    - [[LINK LATER: Dispel | type=mechanic | hint=removing effects; “marginally dispelled”]]
    - [[LINK LATER: Sun Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Pathway referenced for dispelling threshold]]
    - [[LINK LATER: Angel-Level | type=term | hint=power tier referenced for dispelling and timing]]
    - [[LINK LATER: Demigod-Level | type=term | hint=power tier referenced for dispelling threshold]]
    - [[LINK LATER: Gods and Below | type=term | hint=power tier threshold for immediate transformation]]

### Corruption

- **Use:** A **spellcasting action**.
- **Check:** [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=mechanic | hint=check/attribute used]] against [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense used]]; “minus -8 disadvantage.”
  [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether “-8” is a numeric penalty, “disadvantage,” or both, and how it is applied mechanically.]]
- **Effect: Betrayal**
  - You designate a target to corrupt and betray its master.
  - For the same level, you can make the target’s [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Items | type=item | hint=magic/supernatural items]] betray, or make part of the target’s [[LINK LATER: Marionettes | type=mechanic | hint=controlled puppet constructs]] or [[LINK LATER: Clones | type=mechanic | hint=duplicate bodies/entities]] betray.
- **Special: Hanged Man Pathway Targets (Lower Sequence)**
  - For a target lower than you: if the other party and you are both in the Sequence of the Hanged Man, you can directly let her body degenerate and betray her soul, and collapse on the spot.
  - If the target is a demigod, there can only be one [[LINK LATER: Spirit Body | type=term | hint=surviving remnant body/state]] left that can continue to survive an encounter, and can be eliminated midway.
- **Special: Secret Puppet Betrayal**
  - You can also let a [[LINK LATER: Secret Puppet | type=mechanic | hint=specific puppet type]] whose personality is inferior to yours betray on the spot and disconnect the [[LINK LATER: Thread of the Spirit Body | type=mechanic | hint=control link/connection]].
  - Similar products are also suitable for this use method.
  - This is a high-level application of [[LINK LATER: Separating the Fallen Mind | type=mechanic | hint=technique referenced here]], and it will inherit it as a Secret Puppet or all the memories of the avatar era.
    [[UNCLEAR: The final inheritance clause (“inherit it as a Secret Puppet or all the memories of the avatar era”) is grammatically unclear and may describe multiple distinct outcomes.]]
    - [[LINK LATER: Avatar Era | type=other | hint=the “avatar era” referenced for memories]]
