# Sequence 7: Shadow Ascetic

> **Lore:** Can hide in the shadows and wield shadow powers.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** constitution +2, agility +1, strength +1, inspiration +1.
- Your **mysticism** [[LINK LATER: Mysticism | type=mechanic | hint=core attribute or power stat]] can be quickly upgraded to **erudition** [[LINK LATER: Erudition | type=term | hint=advanced mysticism tier]].
- **Stealth** [[LINK LATER: Stealth | type=mechanic | hint=skill or test]] is added to your rapid improvement category [[LINK LATER: Rapid Improvement Category | type=mechanic | hint=skill advancement category]] and can be improved to **proficiency** at most [[LINK LATER: Proficiency | type=term | hint=maximum improvement tier]].

### Darkvision

- **Effect:** You can see normally even in environments without any light.

### Shadow Lurking

- **Cost:** 2 points of **spirituality** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent to use abilities]].
- **Use:** 1 **movement action** [[LINK LATER: Movement Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] to enter **shadow state** [[LINK LATER: Shadow State | type=condition | hint=movable-shadow form]].
- **Effect:** Your body suddenly disintegrates like a body of water, merges into the shadow, and enters **shadow state**:
  - ① You become a movable shadow; agility +3, affecting **physical defense** [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defensive stat]] and mobility.
  - ② Gain **high-speed dodge** [[LINK LATER: High-Speed Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=evasion feature]], keep complete **physical defense** against guns instead of light and lightning, and gain an extra level of **dodge** [[LINK LATER: Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=evasion level]] when facing attacks that are slower than guns; but in **shadow state**, you cannot perform actions other than using shadow abilities [[LINK LATER: Shadow Abilities | type=mechanic | hint=abilities usable in shadow state]].
  - ③ Even in an environment without other shadows, you can move freely as an independent shadow; but if you hide in a dark area or in an existing shadow, you will be considered **invisible** [[LINK LATER: Invisible | type=condition | hint=not seen while concealed]], and exposure will result in detection and tracking.
  - ② In this state, you can pass through places that cannot be entered under normal circumstances, but you can still be hit by abilities.
  - ③ Exiting the **shadow state** is also a **movement action**, and the form of expression is to "grow" out of the shadow.
- **Special:** [[LINK LATER: Master Puppet | type=mechanic | hint=ability that can detect you]], [[LINK LATER: Eye of Mystery | type=mechanic | hint=ability that can detect you]], and [[LINK LATER: Spirit Vision | type=mechanic | hint=vision ability]] of the [[LINK LATER: Path of Fate | type=pathway | hint=pathway referenced for Spirit Vision]] can directly discover you.

[[UNCLEAR: Shadow Lurking lists effects with duplicated item numbering (②/③ repeated), making the intended grouping and ordering of sub-effects uncertain.]]

### Shadow Package

- **Use:** 1 **attack action** [[LINK LATER: Attack Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] or **move action** [[LINK LATER: Move Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]].
- **Cost:** No **spirituality** expended.
- **Limits:**
  - This is a special action, not an extraordinary ability.
  - This special action can only be used in **shadow state**.
- **Effect:**
  - Every time you take an **attack action** or **move action**, you can choose a target to let the **shadow state** "extend" from the ground.
  - Because you can't cover multiple targets at once, you need to decide the order of the targets.
  - Fight against its **physical defenses**, and success will put it into a **grapple state** [[LINK LATER: Grapple State | type=condition | hint=wrapped/restrained by shadow]].
- **Manifestation:** You jump onto the first target and wrap it around, then let the shadow quickly extend to the next target.

### Shadow Hide

- **Cost:** 2 **sanity points** [[LINK LATER: Sanity Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent to use abilities]] per use.
- **Use:** 1 **swift action** [[LINK LATER: Swift Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]].
- **Effect:** You cause your entire appearance to be covered in shadow.
  - ① Others cannot see your shadow-covered face, and can only distinguish the shape and general type of your clothing, but cannot distinguish the color or further characteristics.
  - ② You are regarded as a dark shadow, but unlike hiding in the shadow, you have an entity and can perform all normal activities.
  - ③ As long as you deliberately hide yourself, then in dark environments and other shadows, your stealth test +4 is beneficial.
- **Special:** [[LINK LATER: Master Puppet | type=mechanic | hint=ability that can see through Shadow Hide]], [[LINK LATER: Eye of Mystery | type=mechanic | hint=ability that can see through Shadow Hide]], and [[LINK LATER: Vision of Destiny | type=mechanic | hint=vision ability that can see true face]] can directly see your true face.

### Shadow Manipulation

- **Cost:** 2 points of **spirituality**.
- **Use:** 1 **casting action** [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]].
- **Targeting and range:**
  - Select up to 3 targets within the **field of vision** [[LINK LATER: Field of Vision | type=mechanic | hint=what you can see]].
  - You shape the existing shadows to a certain extent, and the range of influence is as high as 1 kilometer.
- **Resolution:** **mysticism** counters **physical defense**.
- **Effect:**
  - The shadows beyond the range of vision cannot be used accurately, and can only allow other **Beyonders** [[LINK LATER: Beyonder | type=term | hint=extraordinary person]] to detect abnormalities with **spiritual intuition** [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition | type=mechanic | hint=detecting spiritual anomalies]].
  - This ability can't really shape the shadows into specific shapes; it can only turn them into an amorphous "fluid" to attack.
  - The damage depends on the concentration of the surrounding shadows or darkness:
    - ① Areas with shadows caused by occlusion in daylight: 1d6 **curse damage** [[LINK LATER: Curse Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]].
    - ② Areas with shadows caused by occlusion at dusk: 2d6 **curse damage**.
    - ③ Areas without high-intensity light in the dark night: 3d6 **curse damage**; high-intensity light is regarded as dusk.
    - ④ Others: A room with sufficient light is regarded as dusk, and a room without light is regarded as night, regardless of the actual time.
- **Special:** In places continuously illuminated by **divine power** [[LINK LATER: Divine Power Illumination | type=mechanic | hint=light source that weakens shadows]], as long as the corresponding power continues to exist, the intensity of the shadow will drop by 1 level, and the day level will disappear directly, causing you to be unable to use the ability.
