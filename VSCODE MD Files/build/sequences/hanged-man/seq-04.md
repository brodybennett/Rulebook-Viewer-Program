# Sequence 4: Black Knight

## Black Knight

> **Lore:** The shadows turn into armor. You control shadows and separate fallen thoughts.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Under the shroud of shadow, merge with the divine shadow with corrupted power, never separate from each other.
  > **GM Note:** RAW labels this an “unofficial ceremony.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +1, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
- **Skill Increase:** Fighting [[LINK LATER: Fighting (Skill) | type=term | hint=skill name]] and Fighting (Giant Weapon) [[LINK LATER: Fighting (Giant Weapon) (Skill) | type=term | hint=skill name]] skills increase by 1 skill level.  
  [[UNCLEAR: RAW says “fighting and fighting (giant weapon)”; unclear whether this indicates two distinct skills or a duplicated term.]]

### Blade of Soul and Flesh (Core Ability)

- **Effect:** Corrodes flesh and blood, annihilates soul, breaks through barriers, and can invalidate the defense of any creature with [[LINK LATER: Corrupted Thoughts | type=condition | hint=mental corruption state referenced by this ability]].

### Black Knight

- **Cost:** 10 **spirituality points** [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=term | hint=resource spent to activate abilities]].
- **Use:** Free action.
- **Limits:** Only once every 12 hours.
- **Duration:** One encounter.
- **Effect:**
  - You become a ~4-meter-long giant wearing black armor, holding a giant sword, with crimson eyes.
  - Strength +5.
  - Constitution +5 (your Health upper limit also +5). [[LINK LATER: Health | type=term | hint=upper limit of health/HP]]
  - You are regarded as a **super-large creature** [[LINK LATER: Super-Large Creature | type=term | hint=size category used by this ability]].
  - In this state, [[LINK LATER: Shadow Armor | type=mechanic | hint=armor and damage reduction ability]] is active by default.

- **Huge Creature Traits:** [[LINK LATER: Huge Creature Traits | type=mechanic | hint=modifiers listed under “Huge creatures” in RAW]]
  - You deal +1d6 extra damage against Medium creatures.
  - Medium creatures gain +5 on attack rolls against you.
  - Against only Large creatures, this extra damage is reduced to 1d3.
  - You gain +2 on [[LINK LATER: Suffer Check | type=mechanic | hint=check referenced under “Huge creatures” in RAW]]s.

- **While in this state, your Shadow Armor is strengthened:**
  - The [[LINK LATER: Sacred Damage | type=term | hint=damage type]] you take from non-Sun Pathways is halved. [[LINK LATER: Sun Pathway | type=pathway | hint=used to define “non-Sun Pathways”]]
  - You gain 5 points of **temporary Sanity armor** [[LINK LATER: Temporary Sanity Armor | type=mechanic | hint=temporary sanity protection]] for your own use.

- **While in this state, the blade of flesh and blood deals (to living creatures):**
  - An additional 1d2 [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term | hint=resource/track damaged by abilities]] damage.
  - An additional +5 damage.  
  [[UNCLEAR: In this state, RAW says “deal additional and 1d2 sanity damage”; a value may be missing before “and”.]]

- This is not a [[LINK LATER: Mythic Creature Form | type=term | hint=classification used by other rules]].

### Shadow Armor

- **Effect:** The shadow becomes your armor.
  - You gain 5 **Armor** [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=term | hint=defensive stat]] and 5 **Damage Reduction** [[LINK LATER: Damage Reduction | type=term | hint=reduces incoming damage]].
  - Damage Reduction is calculated after [[LINK LATER: Immortal Flesh | type=mechanic | hint=passive damage mitigation]].
- **Limits:** This ability must be used in a [[LINK LATER: Shaded Area | type=location | hint=area with shade required to use certain abilities]].

### Blade of Flesh

- **Effect:** You create a blade of flesh, shadow, and spirit that deals base damage of 2d10. This is **cursed damage**. [[LINK LATER: Cursed Damage | type=term | hint=damage type]]
- **Benefits:**
  - Melee attacks related to the blade of flesh and blood deal an extra 2d6 damage to living creatures.
    - When you use the blade of flesh and blood to attack creatures whose Sanity has not reached the maximum, your hit rate +10. [[LINK LATER: Hit Rate | type=term | hint=attack accuracy modifier]]
  - Your melee attacks ignore [[LINK LATER: Deflection Defense | type=term | hint=defense type ignored]] and Damage Reduction, and can hit [[LINK LATER: Incorporeal Body | type=condition | hint=incorporeal targets]].

### Shadow Raid

- **Cost:** 2 spirituality points.
- **Use:** Move action.
- **Effect:** Rush to a shadow within line of sight; you teleport about 100 meters.
- **Limits:** This ability must be used in a shadowed area, and the shadow must be within your line of sight.

### Spreading Flesh

- **Cost:** 2 spirituality points.
- **Use:** Spell-casting action.
- **Requirements:** **Flesh Stack** 120+ (RAW: “stack of flesh and blood”). [[LINK LATER: Flesh Stack | type=term | hint=resource threshold for Flesh Magic]]
- **Effect:**
  - Your whole body turns into a thin blanket of blood and flesh that spreads rapidly, covering every corner of the room.
  - In this state, you turn into pure flesh and blood and cover the entire room with your body; you become the walls of the entire room, and the walls are full of flesh and blood.
  - Exiting this state requires a free action to coalesce into shape.
- **Limits while active:**
  - You can only use [[LINK LATER: Flesh Magic | type=mechanic | hint=category of abilities]] for [[LINK LATER: Flesh Healing | type=mechanic | hint=healing option within Flesh Magic]]. (RAW: “excluding the passive immortal flesh.”)
  - You can still manipulate flesh creatures, or put a demigod soul outside to fight, but you can’t do more things.
  - Flesh Magic such as [[LINK LATER: Flesh Bomb | type=mechanic | hint=Flesh Magic example explicitly disallowed]] cannot be used.
- **Battlefield effects:**
  - The room covered by you isolates sound from inside and outside.
  - The room cannot be entered or exited by physical means.
  - Anyone else who tries to enter without your consent must kill you first.
- **Additional requirement:** This can usually only be used to cover a room to divide the battlefield. If you want to cover a lobby, your Flesh Stack must be 170+.

### Separation of Fallen Thoughts

- **Cost:** 6 spirituality points.
- **Use:** Casting action.
- **Targeting:** Designate a mad creature. [[LINK LATER: Mad Creature | type=condition | hint=required target state]]
- **Effect:**
  - The designated creature falls into **true half-madness** [[LINK LATER: Half-Madness | type=condition | hint=half-madness state created by this ability]].
  - A shadow copy of this creature appears immediately.
  - Before the original owner completely kills the copy, the original owner’s madness symptoms remain permanently.
    - Generally, it can act normally, but it will be difficult to control emotions when speaking.
    - Occasionally, the madness will aggravate, but basically it will not affect actions.
    - The original owner gains the advantages and disadvantages brought by the madness. [[LINK LATER: Madness | type=condition | hint=advantages/disadvantages and symptoms]]
- **Copy details:**
  - The duplicate body has complete supernatural powers.
  - It shares the remaining Sanity equally with the original.
  - The Sanity upper limit and Will Defense of both parties are halved. [[LINK LATER: Sanity Upper Limit | type=term | hint=maximum sanity]] [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=term | hint=defense stat]]
  - It will not inherit the state of madness.
  - It is a [[LINK LATER: Shadow Creature | type=condition | hint=creature type for copy]] and has strong malice towards the original owner.
  - It will not possess any [[LINK LATER: Supernatural Item | type=item | hint=item category]] or [[LINK LATER: Secret Puppet | type=item | hint=puppet category]].
  - Its appearance is a dark humanoid shadow (if the original owner is human).
- **Negotiation:** You can persuade this creature to help you through negotiation. Since killing the original owner can replace it, and it is malicious to the original owner, most clones will agree to help you.
- **When the clone is killed:**
  - This essentially tears apart a person’s astral body. [[LINK LATER: Astral Body | type=term | hint=spiritual body referenced by this ability]]
  - When the clone is killed, any split Sanity returns with the torn astral body.
- **Additional effects on the original owner:**
  - The original owner who lost half of their soul gains the easy-to-craze effect of the Spectator Pathway in a state of incomplete soul. [[LINK LATER: Easy-to-Craze | type=mechanic | hint=effect referenced as from Spectator Pathway]] [[LINK LATER: Spectator Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Pathway referenced by this effect]] [[LINK LATER: Incomplete Soul | type=condition | hint=soul state after separation]]
  - If the original owner is replenished by an Audience demigod through a virtual personality, then even though they are still half insane, their soul can be temporarily complete. [[LINK LATER: Audience Demigod | type=term | hint=demigod source referenced]] [[LINK LATER: Virtual Personality | type=mechanic | hint=construct used to replenish soul]]
    - The halving of the Sanity upper limit and the upper limit of Will Defense remains unchanged.
    - It is easy to remove the effect of madness, and the original owner no longer gains the advantages and disadvantages of half-madness.
    - The virtual personality can be used as a substitute for mental blows. [[LINK LATER: Mental Blow | type=mechanic | hint=mental damage/attack]]
  - Even if the original owner is illuminated by light, there will be no shadow.

#### Special Use: Extracting a Foreign Consciousness

If you have a consciousness that does not belong to you in your mind (for example, an Audience virtual personality has invaded your mind), you can forcibly pull out this virtual personality using Separation of Fallen Thoughts.

> **Lore:** You turn your hand black and reach into your brain to grab your “island of consciousness,” smash it on the ground, and turn it into a pool of shadows. The shadows show an outline set by the owner (basically only distinguishing men and women).

- **Timing:** After it is separated, it takes two rounds to become independent.
- **Control window:** It remains under the control of its original owner for two rounds.
- **If not resolved in time:** The original owner suffers the normal detached and corrupted mind effects. [[LINK LATER: Detached and Corrupted Mind | type=condition | hint=effect triggered if extraction not resolved]]
- **If this avatar was already insane before being separated:** Separation and degeneration can make it betray immediately (without waiting).
  - Usually, there must be a demigod with the same Spectator Pathway to attack it with Sanity. Your own Sanity attack can basically only be fought with yourself, and even if there is a Spectator Pathway demigod, this virtual personality can resist.
- **Restrictions:**
  - It is extremely difficult to use your own power to make it fall into madness in advance.
  - After pulling it out, because it has already begun to fall into the state of [[LINK LATER: Separated and Corrupted Thoughts | type=condition | hint=state referenced in extraction rules]], you cannot let it fall into the state of [[LINK LATER: Separated and Fallen Thoughts | type=condition | hint=state that cannot be applied again]] again; even if you can, it only affects replicas.
  - The Sanity blow that is replenished after the withdrawal is meaningless.
