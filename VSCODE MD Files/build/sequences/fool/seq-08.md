# Sequence 8: Clown

> **Lore:** A Clown buries sorrow behind a smile—reading people, defying balance, and trusting intuition even when fate feels unchangeable.

## Overview

- Skilled in deft combat with exceptional physical coordination, agility, and speed, and decent Strength.
- Can rely on intuition to predict a target’s next move.
- Can use ordinary paper as a weapon.
- Can effectively read facial expressions and body language, making lies easier to believe.

## Advancement

### Main Materials

- Adult Honakis gray goat horn crystal ×1 [[LINK LATER: Honakis gray goat | type=other | hint=creature source for horn crystal]]
- Rose with a complete human face ×1 [[LINK LATER: Rose with a complete human face | type=item | hint=main material]]

### Auxiliary Materials

- Pure water 80ml
- Datura juice 5 drops [[LINK LATER: Datura juice | type=item | hint=aux material]]
- Black edge sun flower powder 7 grams [[LINK LATER: Black edge sun flower powder | type=item | hint=aux material]]
- Golden mantle grass powder 10 grams [[LINK LATER: Golden mantle grass powder | type=item | hint=aux material]]
- Poison violet juice 3 drops [[LINK LATER: Poison violet juice | type=item | hint=aux material]]

## Acting Rules

- Can slightly predict fate, but feel helpless about fate.
- Cover all sadness, pain, confusion, and frustration with a smiling face.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- Strength +1
- Constitution +2
- Dexterity +2
- Inspiration +1 [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=attribute and related checks]]
- Performance and Deceit increase by 1 level [[LINK LATER: Performance | type=mechanic | hint=skill/ability level system]] [[LINK LATER: Deceit | type=mechanic | hint=skill/ability level system]]

In addition, from now on you will not lose your balance. If you fall, one of your limbs will land firmly. As long as there are still limbs touching the ground, you can stabilize your center of gravity. Even if you fall from a train, as long as you still have a support point, you can still perform acrobatic bounces.

### Premonition of Danger

Also known as intuitive premonition: you can predict the actions of others at critical moments and perceive danger.

- **Use:** Triggered whenever you are raided, sneak attacked, or something on the scene is about to put a raid or sneak attack into action. [[LINK LATER: Raid | type=mechanic | hint=surprise/ambush rules]] [[LINK LATER: Sneak attack | type=mechanic | hint=ambush/backstab rules]]
- **Use (additional trigger):** If a single instance of damage exceeds half of your maximum health (rounded up), this ability can also be triggered. [[LINK LATER: Maximum health | type=mechanic | hint=HP maximum]] [[LINK LATER: Damage instance | type=mechanic | hint=single hit vs cumulative damage]]

When triggered, resolve the following:

1. Make an Inspiration appraisal (**Difficulty Value** 15). [[LINK LATER: Appraisal | type=mechanic | hint=check/roll type]] [[LINK LATER: Difficulty Value | type=term | hint=target number for checks]]
   - On success, an idea flashes in your mind immediately, telling you the form the danger will take.
   - After you succeed, you cannot be raided or ambushed.
   - Threats you mistakenly think are “safe” do not trigger this ability.
2. Under the above premise, as long as you are not restrained or otherwise prevented, your **physical defense** gains a +4 temporary bonus. [[LINK LATER: Physical defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat used vs attacks]] [[LINK LATER: Restrained | type=condition | hint=movement/action limitation]]
   - Against light and lightning, you retain the agility and dodge in physical defense instead of applying the +4 value. [[LINK LATER: Light | type=mechanic | hint=damage/attack type]] [[LINK LATER: Lightning | type=mechanic | hint=damage/attack type]] [[LINK LATER: Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=evasion component]]
3. If the danger’s area is large enough (e.g., a gas explosion across the entire area instantly), even if you are alerted to the danger, you do not gain these benefits. [[LINK LATER: Area effect | type=mechanic | hint=large-area hazards and defenses]]

- **Special:**
  - Dangers higher than 1 level cannot be foreseen. [[LINK LATER: Danger level | type=mechanic | hint=hazard grading by level]]
  - Hazards dependent on luck are foreseeable, but you gain no benefit.
- **Limits:**
  - As a kind of spiritual intuition, danger premonition is invalidated by anti-divination and anti-prophecy. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual intuition | type=mechanic | hint=divination/prophecy source]] [[LINK LATER: Anti-divination | type=mechanic | hint=blocks divination]] [[LINK LATER: Anti-prophecy | type=mechanic | hint=blocks prophecy]]

**Sequence progression (future improvements):**
- Sequence 7: The mind changes from flashing thoughts to flashing images, directly showing the manifestation of danger if not avoided.
- Sequence 6: Your Inspiration identification succeeds by default. [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=check/roll type]]
- Sequence 5: You can foresee danger from more than 1 person. [[UNCLEAR: “danger from higher than 1 person” is unclear—likely “more than one person,” but the exact meaning (sources/targets/participants) is not explicit.]]

### Turn Paper into Flying Knives

The soft paper in your hand can turn into flying knives and fly out; this belongs to the magic class. [[LINK LATER: Magic class | type=mechanic | hint=damage/attack classification]]

- **Use:** 1 attack action. [[LINK LATER: Attack action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]
- **Effect:** Turn paper and tarot cards into flying blades and throw them, dealing 1d4 + half Strength damage die. [[LINK LATER: Strength damage die | type=mechanic | hint=damage die tied to Strength]] [[LINK LATER: Tarot cards | type=item | hint=paper-based thrown weapons]]

Additional rules:

1. Strength damage dice are rounded up to cause physical damage, and are rolled against physical defense. [[LINK LATER: Physical damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]]
2. You can hit consecutively with flying blades and choose multiple targets.
   - You can shoot 3 cards in a row with one attack action.
   - Starting from the second card, you “lose 2 disadvantages” when making the identification throw; you “lose 4 disadvantages” for the third card, and so on, increasing. [[LINK LATER: Disadvantages | type=mechanic | hint=penalty system on rolls]] [[UNCLEAR: RAW says “lose 2 disadvantages” on the second/third card; it is unclear whether this means you incur Disadvantages or remove them, though context suggests a worsening penalty as you continue.]]

### Muscle Mastery

Your precise mastery of muscles gives you an advantage in learning and fighting.

1. Your muscle-related identification is +2 beneficial, including: fighting, throwing, shooting, performing, deceiving, stealth, etc. [[LINK LATER: Beneficial | type=mechanic | hint=bonus/advantage state on checks]]
   - Your stealth makes no sound.
   - When listening against stealth, listening without extraordinary factors fails against you by default. [[LINK LATER: Listening | type=mechanic | hint=perception check]] [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary factors | type=mechanic | hint=supernatural modifiers]]
2. You get fast dodge, keep complete physical defense against firearms (excluding light and lightning), and gain an extra level of dodge. [[LINK LATER: Fast dodge | type=mechanic | hint=enhanced evasive option]] [[LINK LATER: Firearms | type=mechanic | hint=ranged weapon category]] [[LINK LATER: Dodge level | type=mechanic | hint=stacking/tiers of dodge]]
3. 1 quick action; does not consume **Spirituality**: your Performance/Climbing/Jumping identification succeeds by default, and the confrontation changes to +4 to benefit. [[LINK LATER: Quick action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource/energy]] [[LINK LATER: Climbing | type=mechanic | hint=skill/ability]] [[LINK LATER: Jumping | type=mechanic | hint=skill/ability]] [[LINK LATER: Confrontation | type=mechanic | hint=opposed check rules]] [[UNCLEAR: “the confrontation is changed to +4 to benefit” is unclear on whether it replaces the auto-success in opposed situations or adds a bonus in place of a normal opposed-roll procedure.]]
4. The Extraordinary of the Audience Path cannot read your thoughts through body language by default. [[LINK LATER: Audience Path | type=pathway | hint=the “Audience” Pathway]] [[LINK LATER: Read thoughts through body language | type=mechanic | hint=Audience Path ability interaction]]
5. You learn muscle-related skills faster, once every 24 hours:
   - If you receive relevant courses and guidance, and the content is effective, authentic, non-repetitive, and lasts more than 2 hours, your related skills increase by 1 level. [[LINK LATER: Skill level | type=mechanic | hint=training/proficiency ladder]]
   - From training to proficiency, proficiency to advanced, and advanced to proficient, you need to learn 2, 3, and 4 times respectively; you can reach proficiency at most. [[UNCLEAR: The progression “advanced to proficient” appears to reverse the ladder; the intended tier names/order are not explicit, but the required counts (2/3/4) and cap (“at most proficiency”) are preserved verbatim.]]
   - (This is a potion benefit that cannot be recorded or stolen.) [[LINK LATER: Potion benefit | type=mechanic | hint=non-transferable effect]]
