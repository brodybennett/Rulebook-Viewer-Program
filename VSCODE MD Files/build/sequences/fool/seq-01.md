## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials:** A copy of the extraordinary characteristic of “Servant of Mysteries”.  
  [[LINK LATER: extraordinary characteristic | type=term | hint=advancement material category]]

### Advancement Ritual

- **Ritual:** Establish a town purely composed of **Secret Puppets**, and design their own destiny trajectory for each **Secret Puppet**, so that they can interpret a sufficiently real picture of life through mutual interaction, and be born in the corresponding area of the **Spirit World**.

- The larger the town, the more **Secret Puppets**, the more detailed the daily life, the more vivid and real the different destinies, and the longer the stretch, the better the effect of the ceremony.

> **GM Note:** The ritual’s intent is described as combining with **Spirit World** projections to regain one’s essence, prevent complete loss of self amid the washing of ideas/information/knowledge/symbols/signs, and harmonize with the **Spirit World** (“two in one”).

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Inspiration +1, historical skills increased by 1 skill level.

### Grafting

- **Use:** 1 time per round; 1 free action.  
  [[LINK LATER: free action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Effect:** You transfer an **Affix** from one object to another.  
  [[LINK LATER: Affix | type=term | hint=object modifier/attachment]]
- Unlike the affix change caused by a **Lawyer**, both objects still share the same **Affix**.  
  [[LINK LATER: Lawyer | type=pathway | hint=reference point for affix-changing effects]]
- You can graft space and time this way:
  - **Grafting space:** Two areas are distorted and connected together.
  - **Grafting time:** After a certain effect ends, it will immediately enter another time period.

### Regeneration

- **Use:** As a free action.  
  [[LINK LATER: free action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Effect:** You can make a product that once possessed the thread of the spirit body reappear with the thread of the spirit body even if only a part of it is left in fragments or in a state of death, and it can become your **Secret Puppet**.

- **Aftereffects:** If you eat a product regenerated by you (such as steak), that person will immediately become your **Secret Puppet**.

### Mysterious Realm

- **Use:** As a casting action.  
  [[LINK LATER: casting action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Effect:** You create a prototype of the kingdom of God. The surrounding time and space are distorted, so that the area where the target is located is completely isolated from the outside world.
- Even information cannot be interacted with, and the perception of the audience through the collective subconscious sea will be invalid.  
  [[LINK LATER: collective subconscious sea | type=term | hint=shared perception channel]]
- This can bring a certain amount of stealth effect, focusing on the hidden area.
- **Limits:** The largest range is a city.
