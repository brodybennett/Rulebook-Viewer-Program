# Sequence 4: Demon Hunter

## Demon Hunter

- Sensitive to traces of evil, depravity, and pollution.
- Can cover up one’s own actions and intentions, making targets that can foresee danger unable to detect you.
- A nemesis of demons; skilled at discovering the weaknesses of different monsters.
- Skilled at identifying the uses of various materials and, in a unique meditation mode, formulating and producing miraculous potions, holy ointments, essential oils, and special marks—then restraining the target by taking, smearing, or using these items.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Unilaterally kills an evil, depraved, powerful creature that is heavily tainted, and resolves the root cause of the event so related events do not occur again. (unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** strength +2, agility +1, constitution +2, will +2.

### Detect Evil

- **Use:** **Free Action**
- **Check:** **Difficulty Value 15** [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=skill/attribute used for checks]] + [[LINK LATER: Spot | type=term | hint=skill used for perception/spotting]] check.
- **Effect:** Look for signs of evil, corruption, and contamination; see if any evil creatures exist and have visited you.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The scope and timeframe of “exist and have visited you” are not defined.]]
- **Limits/Modifiers:** This ability is penalized by the [[LINK LATER: Avoidance of Scrying | type=mechanic | hint=trait that penalizes detection/scrying]] trait.  
  [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whether the penalty applies based on the user, the target, or the situation.]]

### Demon Hunt Ritual

- **Use:** Perform a ritual where you hunt demons.
- **Time:** 10 minutes.
- **Cost:** 4 [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent to fuel abilities/rituals]].
- **Requirements:** Find the traces of demons and understand the types of demons.
- **Effect:** After the ceremony takes effect, your attack identification results of 18, 19, 20 are considered a [[LINK LATER: Big Success | type=mechanic | hint=enhanced success tier]].
  [[UNCLEAR: “attack identification” is undefined (likely an attack roll/check or identification mechanic).]]

### Mind Barrier

- **Effect:** Conceal your intentions.
  - You can surprise creatures that would not otherwise be surprised.
  - A demon’s danger perception no longer applies to you.

### Spiritual Disturbance

- **Effect:** Against your [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=skill/attribute used for checks]] check, the base check of its Inspiration skill is -5, and may cause a [[LINK LATER: Big Failure | type=mechanic | hint=enhanced failure tier]].  
  [[UNCLEAR: The target, timing, and meaning of “may cause a big failure” are not defined.]]

### Material Identification

- **Effect:** Identify the uses of various materials and prepare corresponding magical potions, holy ointments, essential oils, and special marks.
- **Time:** 1d20 minutes.
- **Check:** **Difficulty Value 20** [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=skill/attribute used for checks]] check.
- **Limits:** Create up to five magical items per day.
- **Storage/Duration:** Unless otherwise specified, magical potions can only be stored or effective for 24 hours.

Here’s a list of the magical items you can craft:

  - **Limits:** Can only take effect twice.
  - **Additional Effect:** Curse, cold, and poison within 5 points can be suppressed or cured.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “within 5 points” and whether suppression vs. cure is chosen or automatic are not defined.]]

- **Essential Oil**
  - **Use:** 1 **Round**.
  - **Effect:** The diffused aroma dispels dark, corrupted, and undead creatures below **Sequence 7** (can be actively resisted).  
    [[UNCLEAR: “dispels” is not defined (e.g., repels, banishes, weakens).]]
  - **Additional Uses:** Refreshes the mind so users can continue to act for a period of time when they are tired.
  - **Additional Uses:** Can be dripped on teammates to distinguish friend from foe through the unique aroma.

- **Choking Potion**
  - **Use:** An action other than a **Free Action**.

- **Mark of Purification**
  - **Use:** An action other than a **Free Action**; attaches to a weapon or object.
  - **Effect:** The next 3 attacks are converted to **holy damage**.
  - **Bonus Damage:** +2d6 against corrupted and dark creatures; +3d6 against undead.

  - **Use:** An action other than a **Free Action**; attaches to a weapon or object.
  - **Effect:** The subsequent three attacks cause **cold damage**.
  - **Aftereffects:** Muscles tremble, frost condenses, and the next skill check is -4.  
    [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear who makes “the next skill check” (the target or another creature) and when it occurs.]]

  - **Use:** An action other than a **Free Action**; attaches to a weapon or item.
  - **Effect:** The damage of the next three attacks is converted into **curse damage**.
  - **Additional Effect:** You can specify what not to hurt, but what to hurt.  
    [[UNCLEAR: The scope of what can be specified (targets, categories, objects) and how it is enforced are not defined.]]

- **Healing Potion**
  - **Effect:** Restores 2d6 health.

- **Purification Potion**
  - **Effect:** Immediately heals all poisons and minor diseases, as well as curses.
  - **Effect:** Causes 3d6 damage to the [[LINK LATER: Wraiths | type=term | hint=wraiths in the body]] in the body.
  - **Effect:** Provides 1d3 [[LINK LATER: Sanity Armor | type=mechanic | hint=protective buffer tied to sanity]] (cannot be superimposed with sanity armor except the [[LINK LATER: Audience Pathway | type=pathway | hint=pathway exception for sanity armor stacking]]).  
    [[UNCLEAR: The “except the Audience Pathway” stacking exception is not precisely defined (who qualifies, and what can stack).]]

> **GM Note:** Other special item effects require approval by the GM.

> **GM Note:** Under special circumstances, you can refer to the [[LINK LATER: Potions Professor | type=term | hint=source list of medicines]] list of medicines for making new medicines. However, the [[LINK LATER: God of War Pathway | type=pathway | hint=pathway suitability for research]] is not a Sequence Pathway suitable for research, so the development of new medicines should be greatly restricted.

- **Imprint Form Variation:** You can change the manufacturing form of different imprints so they grant 10 points of resistance to the corresponding attributes. This cannot be superimposed.  
  [[UNCLEAR: The relationship between “imprints” and the listed marks is not defined, and “corresponding attributes” is unspecified.]]

### God of War

[[UNCLEAR: The “God of War” rules appear unrelated to Sequence 4: Demon Hunter and may belong to another Pathway/Sequence.]]

- **Trigger:** Whenever you fall into [[LINK LATER: Madness | type=condition | hint=madness state/trigger]].
- **Effect:** Temporarily consume 3 points of **Will Cap** to continue fighting in a normal state.
- **Limits:** This does not affect your **Will Defense**.
- **Failure Condition:** If your [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=mechanic | hint=sanity value/track]] reaches a negative value, you immediately lose the will to fight and cannot continue fighting.
- **Recovery:** The lost Will Cap can be restored after an hour.
- **Status Interaction:** You no longer suffer negative effects from blindness, deafness, fear, anger, etc., including negative emotions bestowed by the [[LINK LATER: Black Emperor | type=faction | hint=source of negative emotions/effects]], and will not suffer impairments—although these negative states still exist (e.g., you are still theoretically blind or deaf), you can still act normally through rich combat experience.
- **Limits:** This does not affect [[LINK LATER: Dreaming | type=mechanic | hint=dream-related effects]]; you will be awakened as usual if you are dreamed.
- **Special:** If the enemy that triggers these effects is of a higher sequence level than yours, or is an [[LINK LATER: Audience Pathway | type=pathway | hint=audience-path extraordinary]] Extraordinary of the same level as yours, then you will only be affected by its related identification penalty, and you can still work normally without being affected action.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “related identification penalty” and “without being affected action” are undefined/unclear in timing and meaning.]]

- **Sequence 3 Update:** The lost upper limit of will is restored after half an hour.
