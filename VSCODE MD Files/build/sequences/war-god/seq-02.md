# Sequence 2: Glorious One (Reference Only)

## Overview

- A **Sequence** [[LINK LATER: Sequence | type=term | hint=power rank]] 2 **Angel** [[LINK LATER: Angel | type=term | hint=rank or creature type]] specialized in frontal combat.

> **Lore:** The Glorious One is described as an Angel who excels at head-on battle.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** In a disaster caused by a **Complete Mythical Creature** [[LINK LATER: Complete Mythical Creature | type=term | hint=fully mythical form; can affect an entire country]], challenge the opponent head-on alone and win. *(Unofficial ceremony.)*

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Agility +1, Constitution +2, Will +2.

### Shield of Envelopment (Glory)

- **Use:** As a **full-round action** [[LINK LATER: Full-Round Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]], create a shield of glory strong enough to envelop an entire city-state, converging divine radiance into a cage.
- **Effect:**
  - The shield’s **Health** [[LINK LATER: Health | type=mechanic | hint=hit points or equivalent]] is shared with yours.
  - Your Health increases by an additional 50.
  - The shield conceals and isolates the inside and outside to a certain extent.
  - You may use it to create a seal for yourself, or to isolate yourself from the enemy in a separate small world for a one-on-one duel.
    - As long as the enemy doesn’t defeat you, they can’t get out of that world.
    - **Teleportation** [[LINK LATER: Teleportation | type=mechanic | hint=movement/escape effect]] is limited by the shield.
- **Targeting and range:**
  - Envelops an entire city-state.
- **Limits and interactions:**
  - The shield can also create a situation where you have more than one enemy, “holding all other scattered enemies,” and allowing you to disarm or release others to enter at any time.
    [[UNCLEAR: The text describes both a one-on-one isolated “small world” and simultaneously managing multiple enemies; the exact partition/admission behavior is not fully specified.]]
  - Disabling or otherwise changing the shield requires another **full-round action** [[LINK LATER: Full-Round Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] to achieve it, which may cause you to be attacked.
  - If there is any attempt to leave within the shield, you can use a **free action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]] (once per round) to immediately sprint over and perform a **combat attack test** [[LINK LATER: Combat Attack Test | type=mechanic | hint=attack/contest roll]] on the target to try to directly interrupt the escape behavior.
    - This does not include ethereal teleportation that is only within the shield’s range and has no real effect.
  - Even if there is an escape, the Glory Shield will immediately repair it and re-seal it immediately, and only that person can escape.
- **Extra:**
  - While in the Glory Shield, your Dexterity and Willpower are +2 by default.
    [[UNCLEAR: Attribute Gain lists Agility/Will, but this extra uses Dexterity/Willpower; it’s unclear whether these are the same attributes or separate ones.]]

> **Lore:** “The city is there, the shield is there, and the glory is there… In a frontal battle, no one can escape. There is only one thing they can do: face you and defeat you.”
