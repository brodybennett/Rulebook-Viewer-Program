# Sequence 6: Dawn Knight

> **Lore:** Possessing giant-like power, you can fill the surroundings with morning light. This light can break illusions, disperse the shadows of resentful souls, and weaken evil spirits.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2, Constitution +2, Agility +1, Inspiration +1.
- **Skill Gain:** Occultism +1 level.

> **GM Note:** Your giant strength can make every step you take shake the surroundings; this effect can be controlled.

### Armor of Dawn

As a free action and at the expense of 3 spirituality points, you create a suit of silver-white armor covering your entire body (including gauntlets, breastplates, and crowned helmets, among other pieces). It has no obvious weight.

- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points
- **Use:** Free action
- **Effect:** You gain 5 points of armor and 3 points of external damage reduction.

Different judgments are made according to the following conditions:

1. **Gap (Defense Breached):** If an attack breaks through your physical defense and causes ≥ 10 effective damage, that part of the Armor of Dawn is considered to have a **Gap**.
   - While that part has a Gap, a critical strike there ignores the benefits of Armor of Dawn and gains a damage bonus of 1d6.

2. **Unbroken Defense Limit:** If the attack continues but does not meet the Gap condition above, Armor of Dawn can only provide you with 2 defenses at most on the same body part; from the third time, you can be hit by a vital blow.
   - As long as the opponent’s [[LINK LATER: Identification | type=mechanic | hint=attack/strike resolution result used vs defenses]] result is > your Agility + [[LINK LATER: Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=defensive value added to Agility]], if it fails, it is regarded as being blocked by your armor.
   - The independent additional damage bonus in the Gap benefit does not apply to this Unbroken Defense condition.  
     [[UNCLEAR: “independent additional damage bonus” is not clearly scoped (whether it refers only to the 1d6 bonus on critical strikes or something broader).]]

3. **Repair Armor:** Damage to Armor of Dawn is automatically repaired; a Gap is fully restored after 2 rounds.

- At [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=the next advancement tier referenced by this file]]: Armor of Dawn is changed to 7 points of armor, 5 points of external damage reduction, and the number of damages that have not broken through the defense is 3 times.

### Gather Dawn

You can gather (condense) different weapons. The strongest is a two-handed giant sword.

- **Use:** 1 swift action
- **Cost:** 3 spiritual points
- **Effect:** Condense any one of the weapons below. The weapon lasts for 8 rounds.
- **Borrowing Protection:** When using these weapons to perform the special action of [[LINK LATER: Borrowing Protection | type=mechanic | hint=special action referenced by Dawn weapons]], you get the armor corresponding to the volume of the item.

**Special:** As long as the enemy is not larger than 1 character, when the dawn weapon is about to be destroyed, you can use 1 spirituality to recast it immediately.  
[[UNCLEAR: “enemy is not larger than 1 character” is undefined (size/scale threshold is not clearly specified).]]

Available weapons:

1. **Sword of Dawn:** The medium/large Sword of Dawn can cause damage of 1d8 / 2d6+Strength damage dice respectively.
   - The large Sword of Dawn is a two-handed giant sword that can attack targets within 1 meter.
   - Against enemies in contact at 0 distance, it suffers -2 unfavorable on the enemy (as written).  
     [[UNCLEAR: The “-2 to enemies in contact with 0 distance unfavorable” phrasing is ambiguous about whether it is a penalty to your Identification/attack, a modifier to the target, or another mechanic.]]
   - [[UNCLEAR: The medium Sword of Dawn damage expression does not explicitly include Strength (only the large value shows “+Strength”).]]

2. **Dawn Quick Bow:** Deals 1d3 + half Strength damage bonus damage.
   - 1 attack action can shoot up to 3 arrows.
   - Each arrow needs to use 1 swift action and consumes 1 spiritual concentration.
   - Shooting range (in meters) equals your Strength value.

3. **Dawn Longbow:** Deals 1d8 + Strength damage bonus damage.
   - Same as (2), but can only shoot 1 round, and the range is twice your Strength value.  
     [[UNCLEAR: “can only shoot 1 round” is unclear (likely means only 1 shot/arrow per attack action, but the text does not explicitly say).]]

4. **Dawn Whip:** Deals 1d4 + half Strength damage bonus damage.
   - 1 attack action can attack up to 3 times in a row.
   - You can choose a target within 1 meter.
   - The second Identification is -4 disadvantageous; the third Identification is -6 disadvantageous.

**Special (Cleansing Effect):** Every hit of your Dawn weapon increases the restraint damage by 1d6 against spirit creatures.

- At [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=the next advancement tier referenced by this file]]: All your Dawn weapons add 1d2 to their base damage.
- [[LINK LATER: GM Adjudication | type=other | hint=rules permission for adding reasonable Dawn weapons]] Other moderators allow and reasonable Dawn weapons; all Dawn weapons are holy damage.  
  [[UNCLEAR: This line mixes GM permission language with a definitive damage-type statement; the intended scope/authority is unclear.]]

### Create Dawn

You fill the surroundings with bright, clean, and holy dawn, which can break illusions, disperse the shadows of resentful souls, and weaken evil spirits.

- **Use:** 1 casting action
- **Duration:** Every 1 point of spirituality lasts for 1 minute.
- **Area:** A dawn field within 50 meters of you as the center; it moves with you.

Effects within the morning sun:

1. The brightness within the range is like dawn; there is no longer shadow and darkness.
2. Within the range, the hallucinations no larger than 1 person of you are automatically dispelled.  
   [[UNCLEAR: “hallucinations no larger than 1 person of you” is undefined (size/strength/scale threshold unclear).]]
3. Without Extraordinary characteristics, ordinary wraith shadows are purified immediately. Extraordinary spirit creatures with a certain strength start to suffer 1d6 sacred damage every round, and the skill and attribute evaluation continues to suffer -2 disadvantages.
4. Creatures such as fallen/darkness feel uncomfortable at most, because the mystery of the holy power of the Dawn Knight is relatively low.  
   [[UNCLEAR: The terms “fallen/darkness,” “mystery,” and the exact mechanical impact of “feel uncomfortable at most” are not defined here.]]

### Storm of Light

You create a storm of light that sweeps the surroundings, which can directly destroy the human body, eliminate resentful souls, and traumatize evil spirits.

- **Use:** 1 spell-casting action
- **Cost:** 3 points of spirituality
- **Requirement:** Must be cast with a weapon.
  - If it is a dawn weapon, the consumption of spirituality can be changed to consume its duration of 2 rounds as an alternative.

Choose one of the following:

1. **Insert into the ground:** You insert the weapon into the ground, making it bloom with the color of the morning light, creating a 10-meter Storm of Light centered on you.
   - Resolution: mysticism against the physical defense of all creatures, ignoring the agility and dodge in physical defense, and being regarded as for the light.  
     [[UNCLEAR: The attack/check structure (“mysticism against physical defense”) and the clause “being regarded as for the light” are not fully coherent as written.]]
   - Damage: Deals 2d6 holy and 1d6 fire damage to all creatures in the area, including you.
   - Armor interaction: You count as a breach of the Armor of Dawn; you lose the Armor of Dawn on your lower body.

2. **Sweep out:** You choose a direction within 10 meters, sweep out the weapon, and create a Storm of Light that sweeps away.
   - Unlike (1), this specifies a direction without harming you.
   - Damage: Causes 2d6 holy and 1d6 fire damage.

**Special:** Storm of Light increases 1d6 damage of divine restraint against spiritual enemies.

- At [[LINK LATER: Sequence 5 | type=sequence | hint=the next advancement tier referenced by this file]]: Storm of Light is changed to 3d6 holy and 1d6 fire damage, and does not cause damage to you.
