# Witch Pathway: Sequence 3

## Immortality

- See also: [[LINK LATER: Witch Pathway | type=pathway | hint=overall pathway entry]]

> **Lore:** Eternal youth—strange and difficult to kill. Skilled in resurrection and rebirth, petrification, and transmitting power through the **Mirror World** [[LINK LATER: Mirror World | type=location | hint=realm accessed via mirrors]]. Can perfectly present the charm of women at every stage, matching skin condition and facial features.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Create a man-made disaster that can cause at least 10,000 people to suffer, and under the high pressure of hatred, escape the revenge and punishment that the disaster will bring immediately. (unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Dexterity +2, Constitution +1, Will +1, Charisma +2, Inspiration +2.

### Extraordinary Lifespan

- You will not grow old or die; your lifespan will exceed at least 1400 years without weakening.
- Whenever you die, you will be reborn in the **Mirror World** [[LINK LATER: Mirror World | type=location | hint=realm accessed via mirrors]], recovering 2d10 **Health Points** [[LINK LATER: Health Points | type=term | hint=hit point total]].
- The number of resurrections is up to you. Each time you resurrect, you need to advance your **Spiritual Limit** [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Limit | type=mechanic | hint=limit used for spirituality-related capacity]] by 5 points, that is, your limit -5. You get one chance at your resurrection.
  - [[UNCLEAR: The text says “advance your spiritual limit by 5 points” but also “your limit -5”; it is unclear whether this is an increase or a decrease, though “-5” is explicit.]]
- Rebirth from the Mirror World appears in the nearest mirror, or a mirror you have set in advance.
- If your death is in the Mirror World, you will not be able to resurrect.

### Medusa

- **Cost:** **Free Action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]].
- **Use:** Once per round.
- **Effect:** You cause all targets within your line of sight to begin petrifying. This is a **curse** [[LINK LATER: Curse | type=condition | hint=effect category]] effect that can be dispelled [[LINK LATER: Dispel | type=mechanic | hint=remove effects]] or resisted by **Resistance** [[LINK LATER: Resistance | type=mechanic | hint=defensive resistance mechanic]].
- **Targeting and range:** All targets within your line of sight.
- **Progression:** Each round, use your Charisma to attack the **physical defenses** [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat against physical attacks]] of all creatures within range, and if successful, increase the **Petrification Level** by 1.
  - [[UNCLEAR: The ability defines “line of sight” targeting but then refers to “within range”; this section does not define whether “range” differs from “line of sight.”]]

- **Petrification Level 1:** The creature's skin is partially stained with lime, leaving only one **Free Action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]] per round.
- **Petrification Level 2:** The creature's limbs are almost frozen, and it takes two turns to move and attack. At this time, it can give up one of the actions to complete one of the actions in one turn, and there is still one **Free Action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]].
- **Petrification Level 3:** The creature can take no **Move Actions** [[LINK LATER: Move Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]], takes two turns to attack, and only one **Free Action** [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]].
- **Petrification Level 4:** The creature turns to stone until someone removes its curse. Killing the target during this phase is considered death, and the independent **Health Points** [[LINK LATER: Health Points | type=term | hint=hit point total]] of the petrified state are half of the current hit points.
