# Witch Pathway: Sequence 4

- See also: [[LINK LATER: Witch Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Pathway for the Witch Sequence line]]

## Despair

> **Lore:** Spread the plague and create various man-made disasters.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Through one or several incidents, let yourself fall into extreme pain and near despair, so you feel your own insignificance, and take the [[LINK LATER: Magic Potion | type=item | hint=advancement potion for this Sequence]] in the process of craving to change the status quo.
  > **GM Note:** The RAW labels this as an “unofficial ceremony.”

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Agility +2, Constitution +1, Will +2, Charisma +1

### Man-Made Disasters

- **Effect:** Your ability to spread disease and create disasters is enhanced.
- **Targeting and range:** Your **Blight Aura** [[LINK LATER: Blight Aura | type=mechanic | hint=aura tied to spreading disease/disaster]] is now wide enough to cover a small town, and can spread wider under certain conditions by exploiting existing potential hazards.
- **Process (hazard amplification):**
  - You must explore relevant successful events and discover potential man-made disasters that are harbingers and exploitable; you can amplify them.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “relevant events that have been successful in the mod” is unclear (what “mod” refers to and what qualifies as “successful”).]]
  - Example: For smog and weather pollution, with sufficient preparation you can intervene in one source of the problem once, and immediately amplify it through **8-point spiritual ritual magic** [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Ritual Magic | type=ritual | hint=uses “8-point” as written]].
- **Smog example (plague-like effect):**
  - Passing through the smog has an effect similar to a very strong plague.
  - People infected by this magnified disaster plague enter **Infection Level 2** from the beginning. [[LINK LATER: Infection Level | type=mechanic | hint=levels referenced: 1 and 2]]
  - Doctor care requires at least a **Physical** level of 20 for it to not be spread. [[LINK LATER: Physical | type=term | hint=stat/level used for medical care]]  
    [[UNCLEAR: It is unclear whose “Physical level” must be 20 (the doctor, the patient, or another stat holder) and what “not be spread” precisely refers to.]]
  - Infected people below **Sequence 8** directly enter **Infection Level 1** regardless of the situation, under the premise that they have not directly encountered you.  
    [[UNCLEAR: The interaction between “below Sequence 8,” “directly enter Infection Level 1,” and the prior statement about starting at Infection Level 2 is unclear.]]
  - This can almost instantly take the life of a person with poor constitution.
  - Each round will gradually increase the level of charm against you, as long as exposure is via the haze as the medium of transmission; this confrontation is without exception.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “increase the level of charm against you” is unclear (what value changes, for whom, and in which direction).]]
  - During this process, your spreadable range is greatly enhanced according to the spread of the smog. If not stopped, its range will be at least half of [[LINK LATER: Backlund | type=location | hint=setting location referenced for range]].
- **Damage (infection):** Poison damage increases from **1d6 + infection level damage** to **2d4 + infection level damage**.
- **Other pollution disasters:** In addition to plague effects, you can cause other pollution disasters according to the specific situation, including but not limited to:
  - Floods caused by man-made causes
  - Soil erosion, desertification, species resource depletion
  - Greenhouse effect, sandstorms, climate anomalies, ozone layer destruction
  - Locust plague, drought
- **Disaster as transmission medium:**
  - Each disaster above can be used as the transmission medium of your **Plague Halo** [[LINK LATER: Plague Halo | type=mechanic | hint=halo used as transmission scope]].
  - Sandstorms sweeping across are regarded as the scope of your plague halo.
  - Locust plagues can be identified as plagues as long as locusts touch them, causing toxin effects.
  [[UNCLEAR: RAW alternates between “Blight Aura” and “Plague Halo”; it is unclear if these are the same mechanic or distinct mechanics.]]
- **Limits (creating disasters):**
  - You need a clear enough sign that has been regarded as a potential hazard and has caused certain vigilance and effects (example: Backlund’s industrial smog problem).
  - You must personally participate in these events to touch their source and make certain preparations to amplify them.
  - If conditions are right, they can be vectors for the spread of your plague.
- **Progression:** This ability will be substantially improved in [[LINK LATER: Sequence 2 | type=sequence | hint=stated future improvement point]].

### Mirror Illusion

- **Use:** As a free action, once per turn.
- **Cost:** 3 spirituality points. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality Points | type=mechanic | hint=resource spent for abilities]]
- **Targeting and range:** You create an extremely realistic illusion in a place where a mirror can reflect it.
- **Effect:**
  - The premise is that the thing under illusion really exists here, so it can be “reflected.”
  - You can create illusions of:
    - Yourself
    - Items in your possession (which can be given to others)
    - An enemy’s own image
  - You can even “teleport” your image remotely this way, as if you were there in person.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “teleport your image remotely” is unclear about range, destination rules, and whether this is purely sensory or grants further interaction.]]
- **Opposition:** Charm check against Will defense. [[LINK LATER: Charm Check | type=mechanic | hint=check used to establish the illusion]] [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense used vs Charm]]
- **Disbelieving the illusion:**
  - Only when the enemy senses something clearly amiss are they allowed to discover the truth with a Scout or Inspiration check of **20 + your Pleasing stat**. [[LINK LATER: Scout | type=term | hint=check/skill name]] [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=term | hint=check/skill name]] [[LINK LATER: Pleasing | type=term | hint=stat referenced for the check]]
  - In any mirrored environment other than this, the illusion will be extremely real and indistinguishable.  
    [[UNCLEAR: “In any mirrored environment other than this” is unclear about what condition it contrasts with and when the illusion becomes indistinguishable.]]
- **Additional (Sequence 4):** When digestibility reaches **20**, you can also directly transmit power through the mirror. [[LINK LATER: Digestibility | type=mechanic | hint=threshold value 20 at Sequence 4]]
