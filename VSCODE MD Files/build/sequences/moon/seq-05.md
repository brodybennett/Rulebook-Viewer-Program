# Viscount Bloodline Pathway: Sequence 5

## Crimson Scholar

- See also: [[LINK LATER: Viscount Bloodline Pathway | type=pathway | hint=Pathway overview]]

There are two core abilities:
- Create an environment beneficial to yourself by creating a “full moon” effect or hiding the moon.
- Within a certain range illuminated by moonlight, gain the ability to teleport/flash and enter a moonlight state; even if crushed by someone, you can be reassembled in the moonlight.

The strength of these abilities depends on your understanding and research of the “Moon” field. Darkness spells become stronger, potions are more effective, and you gain resistance to nightmare effects. [[LINK LATER: Nightmare effects | type=condition | hint=sleep/nightmare-related effects]]

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Auxiliary Materials (unofficial examples):** Metals, gemstones, and blood of supernatural beings representing different moon states.

**Metal (moon symbol, mysticism):**
- Pure silver (about 10–40 grams)

**Gemstones (moon symbol, occultism):**

| Gemstone (collective name) | Corresponding moon phase |
|---|---|
| Star moon stone | New moon |
| Crescent stone | Crescent moon |
| Upper string stone | First quarter moon |
| Full convex stone | Waxing gibbous |
| Moonstone | Full moon |
| Wan convex stone | Waning gibbous |
| Lower string stone | Last quarter moon |
| Waning moon stone | Waning moon |
| Garnet | New moon |

**Extraordinary biological blood (moon symbol, occultism):**
- The blood of Pegasus
- The crown jellyfish
- The blood of creatures living around the fountain of elves
- The blood of vampires or artificial vampires

> **GM Note:** Ritual gem description:
> - Because there are many branches of gemstones symbolizing a single moon phase (e.g., more than one gemstone can symbolize the new moon or first quarter moon), the moon-phase name is used collectively here. You may buy several different kinds, but any one that meets the requirement can symbolize that moon phase—choose one.
> - Because the astronomical moon phase is a cycle, a full cycle requires two different gems that symbolize the “new moon,” so they can connect end to end. (Analogy given: if gathering “East Rising” for the sun, you would need two “East Rising” to meet a cycle.)
> - In the gemstone list, the first and last gems are intended to fulfill the “two new moon” requirement (e.g., star moon stone and garnet), so there is no need to buy two star moon stones separately—use the list to buy.
> - [[UNCLEAR: The note also states the first and last gemstones symbolize the crescent moon, which conflicts with the provided phase mapping where the first and last correspond to the new moon.]]

> **GM Note:** Price guidance (setting-facing):
> - Average unit price of metals and gems is not expensive in the Lord of Mysteries worldview.
> - A single gem will not exceed 1–2 pounds if the need is not much.
> - Because extraordinary creature blood is not the main material, costs are reduced; you can collect them for about 50–100 pounds.
> - Under normal circumstances, total consumption will not exceed 100 pounds.
> - The point is there is no market price: gems/metals can be found in a few different jewelry stores on average; blood can be collected by attending a few extraordinary parties (common material).

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Under the light of the full moon, gather enough metals, gemstones, and blood of supernatural beings representing different moon states.

> **Lore:** Role-playing rules: devoutly like the moon, worship the moon, study the moon.

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +1, Constitution +1, Agility +1, Inspiration +2. [[LINK LATER: Inspiration | type=mechanic | hint=attribute used for checks/identifications]]

### Moon Knowledge (Skill)

A special knowledge skill is trained: **Moon Knowledge**. [[LINK LATER: Moon Knowledge | type=skill | hint=Moon field research; called “Lunar lore/knowledge” elsewhere]]  
This skill belongs to the educational skill, is included in the rapid growth category of Sequence 9, and can be quickly promoted to proficiency at most. [[LINK LATER: Sequence 9 rapid growth category | type=mechanic | hint=skill advancement category]]

### Sleep-Related Resistance

From now on, against attempts to force you with sleep-related abilities:
- If no identification is required, the user must use **Inspiration** to fight against your **Will Defense** for the effect to take hold. [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense vs mental/compulsion effects]]
- If identification is required, your **Countermeasure** or **Will Defense** +4 is beneficial. [[LINK LATER: Countermeasure | type=mechanic | hint=opposed check/defense mechanic]]

### Summon Full Moon

- **Use:** 1 **swift action**. [[LINK LATER: Swift action | type=mechanic | hint=action economy]]
- **Cost:** 3 points of **spirituality**. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource points]]
- **Targeting and range:** Affecting an area within a few hundred meters.
- **Effect:** You unleash a crimson moonglow (a “full moon” effect), or cause the moon to disappear into the sky. At this time, it is regarded as a full moon state. All creatures illuminated by the moonlight, and all identifications related to **Inspiration**, gain +1.

**Moon Knowledge scaling**
- For every “Lunar lore level” you have (i.e., Moon Knowledge level), all checks related to **Inspiration** get +1 again.
- Thus, while your Lunar lore is “in train,” all friendly creatures gain +2 to inspiration-related checks.
- [[UNCLEAR: “Lunar lore level,” “in train,” and how the repeated +1 stacks with the base +1 are not fully defined.]]

**Advantages of other full moon astronomical phenomena**
1. **Extra spirituality:** Under the full moon, everyone who is illuminated can get 1d6 temporary extra spirituality; during a blood moon, they can get 2d6 temporary extra spirituality. [[LINK LATER: Blood moon | type=mechanic | hint=astronomical phenomenon]]
2. The Crimson Scholar of **Sequence 5** can add an additional amount of spirituality equivalent to increasing their moon knowledge bonus on top of this base value.  
   [[UNCLEAR: “equivalent to increasing his moon knowledge bonus” is not quantified.]]

> **GM Note:** When polluted by the primordial moon, or when the transcendent of the moon path is a believer of the primordial moon (Fallen Goddess), the moon summoned by it is mostly a blood-red full moon. [[LINK LATER: Primordial Moon | type=term | hint=cosmic entity/phenomenon]] [[LINK LATER: Fallen Goddess | type=term | hint=primordial moon believer]]

#### Moonlight Coverage by Sequence (Future Sequences)

- **Sequence 4:** Moonlight can cover a range with a radius of one kilometer, suppressing Sequence 5 and below the sun path brilliance, and last one encounter under the natural sun. (Brightness of Sequence 5 and below can still illuminate, but it can no longer cover up the moonlight, cannot completely dispel darkness and shadows, and can still illuminate traces of ghosts, and the same applies to subsequent upgrades) [[LINK LATER: Sun Path brilliance | type=mechanic | hint=sun-path light/brilliance effects]]
- **Sequence 3:** Moonlight can cover a city and cover the natural sun for half an hour, but it cannot suppress Sequence 4's sun path brilliance.
- **Sequence 2:** If you want, it can cover half a continent, can cover the natural sunlight and last for 12 hours of full moon radiance, suppress the sun path brilliance spell below sequence 2.
- **Sequence 1:** The radiance of the full moon that can cover the entire continent and last for 24 hours, cannot suppress the sun path brilliance of Sequence 2.

### Moonlight

- **Use:** 1 **swift action**.
- **Cost and duration:** Every 3 points of **spirituality** lasts for 1 round.
- **Limits (requirement):** You must be within the range of moonlight to use it.
- **Effect:** You become a beam of moonlight. Your body is broken into crimson moonlight fragments; you are regarded as being in a **moonlight state** and gain the following benefits:

1. **Reorganization:** Whenever your health value is reduced to 0, if you are in the moonlight you recover 2d6 life and transform into the moonlight form, provided that:
   - you have not been hit by the heart,
   - you are at the disadvantage of being hit by the heart, or
   - you are hit by heart to die.  
   [[LINK LATER: Hit by the heart | type=mechanic | hint=critical/vitals rule]]  
   This also applies under holy attack as long as you are under moonlight, and the holy attack is not greater than 1 character.  
   [[UNCLEAR: “at the disadvantage of being hit by the heart” and “holy attack is not greater than 1 character” are undefined.]]

2. **Movement:** In the moonlight state:
   - You gain the ability to fly.
   - You are immune to physical/toxin damage.
   - You will not be affected by environmental effects (such as heat/cold).
   - You are considered invisible.
   - You will not be hit by the vitals. [[LINK LATER: Vitals | type=mechanic | hint=critical hit location/mechanic]]
   - Only a single-target attack that locks your position, or a ranged attack can attack you; otherwise it will pass through your body.

3. **Discovery:** Destiny, Mystic Eye, and Puppet Master's Spiritual Line Vision can all locate you. [[LINK LATER: Destiny | type=mechanic | hint=locating sense]] [[LINK LATER: Mystic Eye | type=mechanic | hint=locating sense]] [[LINK LATER: Puppet Master's Spiritual Line Vision | type=mechanic | hint=locating sense]]  
   Trying to discover your location requires a successful spiritual intuition identification. Normal detection of invisible creatures is not applicable to you. [[LINK LATER: Spiritual Intuition identification | type=mechanic | hint=perception/identification check]]

4. **Action:** In the moonlight state:
   - You can only perform movement actions/free actions.
   - You can fly and move a distance equal to your movement force. [[LINK LATER: Movement force | type=mechanic | hint=movement stat (also called mobility/movement power)]]
   - You cannot perform free/quick/attack/casting spells.
   - You can use the extraordinary ability of the flash of the moon (see **Lunar Blink**).
   - [[UNCLEAR: The text both permits and forbids free actions in the moonlight state.]]

**Moon Knowledge improvement**
- Each level of Moon Knowledge provides an additional chance to reorganize, and this reorganization will not consume spirituality.
- If you suffer a holy blow in the moonlight state, you will be forced to reorganize because the surrounding moonlight disappears, and you will be transformed back to the original form. This forcefully consumes your spirituality or reorganization opportunities; if not, it consumes your sanity. [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=mechanic | hint=mental stability resource]]
- Holy Strikes that are one character or two sequence levels below you can't do this. [[LINK LATER: Holy Strike | type=mechanic | hint=holy/light attack category]]  
  [[UNCLEAR: “one character” and how it combines with “two sequence levels below” are undefined.]]

**If the moonlight does not fully illuminate the entire scene**
- You will be targeted by single-target attacks due to your limited range of movement or being too visible as a lone moonlight, provided the enemy is aware of your presence.
- In this case, summoning 1 full moon will usually solve the problem in this regard.

### Lunar Blink

- **Use:** 1 **swift action**; 1 time per round.
- **Cost:** 3 points of **spirituality**.
- **Effect:** You are broken into crimson moonlight fragments. Choose a distance not exceeding your movement power, flash to the corresponding position, and reorganize into a human form at the corresponding position. [[LINK LATER: Movement power | type=mechanic | hint=movement stat used for blink distance]]

1. **Reactive use:** If you use this ability when you are about to be attacked, you can jump like a flame, directly avoiding the attack on your current position, excluding light/lightning, and you must flash out of the range for range attack.  
   [[UNCLEAR: “excluding light/lightning” and “flash out of the range for range attack” are not precisely defined.]]

2. **Moon Knowledge scaling:** Every time you increase the level of Moon Knowledge, your flashable distance increases:
   - Trained = your mobility
   - Proficient = twice your mobility
   - Advanced = your triple mobility
   - and so on.

3. **Incompatibility:** High-speed movement and Moon Flash cannot be used at the same time, so it cannot increase the flash distance for you. [[LINK LATER: High-speed movement | type=mechanic | hint=movement booster/condition]]

**Additional scaling**
- Every time a sequence level is increased: the mobile power multiplier of the teleportation flash of each moon knowledge level +1.
- Every upgrade of 1 character: the mobile power multiplier of the teleportation flash of each moon knowledge level +2.
- [[UNCLEAR: How these multipliers stack with the Trained/Proficient/Advanced mobility scheme is not specified.]]

### Potion Effect Enhancement

This is an ability enhancement brought by the sequence; it is not regarded as a separate extraordinary ability, but is listed specifically.

From now on, every time you make a magic potion, choose one of the following benefits to upgrade to the potion:
1. **Attribute/Armor/Reduction Improving Potion:** Benefits from attribute enhancement +1.
2. **Harmful potions:** Increase damage by 1d6. If the potion of destruction is a mixed effect of multiple types of damage, all types of damage will increase by 1d6, but the intensity must be agreed by your **GM**. [[LINK LATER: Potion of destruction | type=item | hint=harmful potion with mixed damage]]
3. **Special effect potions:** For example, invisibility/odorless potions can gain additional bonuses; the favorable tendency should be related to the effects of the potions. For example, invisibility may be confronted by detection, so it can make stealth identification extra +2 beneficial. [[LINK LATER: Stealth identification | type=mechanic | hint=stealth vs detection check]]
4. **Potions with negative effects:** Potions with negative effects (e.g., fire dragon breathing cannot speak). You can clear this less serious effect. Other effects (such as use time limit): you can consider halving the value and rounding up. [[LINK LATER: Fire dragon breathing | type=item | hint=potion example with speech restriction]]
5. **Other benefits:** Your **GM** must agree to the final effect of your medicine.
