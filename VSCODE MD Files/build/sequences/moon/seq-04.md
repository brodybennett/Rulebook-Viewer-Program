# Sequence 4: Shamen King (Blood Count)

## Shamen King (Blood Count)

> **Lore:** **Witch King**s can easily live to a thousand years old and are among the long-lived demigods, but they will inevitably enter irreversible old age and decline afterward.
>
> **Lore:** They are outstanding individuals who control the power of darkness, the moon, strangeness, and other fields, surpassing powerhouses of the same kind. They are proficient in various spells in the moon and dark realms, and can arrange rituals that directly borrow the power of the “moon” by relying on natural interaction methods—this is terrifying.
>
> **Lore:** They have a strong physique, terrifying speed, regeneration, and self-healing speed beyond imagination, but they are closer to the caster.

## Advancement

### Advancement Ritual

- **Advancement Ritual:** Under the illumination of the full moon, borrow power from the moon through rituals to research unique and powerful magic in the moon domain or dark domain. (unofficial ceremony)

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Constitution +2, Dexterity +2, Strength +1, Will +1; your [[LINK LATER: Occultism | type=term | hint=skill level]] goes up by one level.

### Moon Paper Man

- **Cost:** **Free action**; 1 point of **spirituality** per use. [[LINK LATER: Spirituality | type=mechanic | hint=resource points]] [[LINK LATER: Free Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Use:** Use a paper man/paper doll (a moon paper figurine) as a **Stand-in** to resist damage you take. [[LINK LATER: Stand-in | type=mechanic | hint=substitute/double effect]]
- **Effect:** The moon paper figurine wards off one of the following that targets you: disease, wound, curse, attack, prophecy, or gaze.
- **Limits:**
  - Production requires a unique process in the moon domain.
  - The number of moon paper figurines you have equals your “moon knowledge” level. [[LINK LATER: Lunar Knowledge | type=term | hint=moon knowledge skill/level]]
  - If your moon knowledge level is a Master, you can carry up to 5 moon paper figurines at the same time, and only 1 for training. [[UNCLEAR: The restriction “only 1 for training” is not defined (what training is, and how it limits carrying/using figurines).]]
  - **Area damage and multiple Stand-ins:** [[LINK LATER: Area Damage | type=mechanic | hint=range/area-of-effect damage rules]]
    - In addition to being consumed multiple times by the Stand-in described separately, when suffering range damage, at least two Stand-ins must be consumed to completely avoid the damage; consuming only one Stand-in causes you to suffer half the damage. [[UNCLEAR: “Consumed multiple times by the Stand-in described separately” references rules not present in this section.]]
    - Specific area damage (examples: meteorite of fate, lightning storm of the tyrant, dark control of the bishop of fear) requires at least three Stand-ins to completely avoid it. [[LINK LATER: Meteorite of Fate | type=ability | hint=example of specific area damage]] [[LINK LATER: Tyrant | type=pathway | hint=source of “lightning storm” example]] [[LINK LATER: Lightning Storm | type=ability | hint=example of specific area damage]] [[LINK LATER: Bishop of Fear | type=sequence | hint=source of “dark control” example]] [[LINK LATER: Dark Control | type=ability | hint=example of specific area damage]]
    - If the source of the area damage is one level lower than yours, the number of Stand-ins you need is -1; otherwise, +1 on the original basis.
    - This +1 also applies to specifically marked area skills, and cannot be reduced to 0; a minimum of 1 Stand-in is still needed.
- **Special:** The moon paper figurine can be given to another person to use once if necessary.
  - Each person can only get one piece per day.
  - The paper figurine expires after one year.

> **GM Note:** The paper figurines of the Fool’s Path are ordinary paper figurines in essence, so they can only be used by extraordinary people of the Fool with extraordinary abilities and are not considered extraordinary items. [[LINK LATER: Fool Pathway | type=pathway | hint=referenced as “Fool’s Path”]] [[LINK LATER: Extraordinary Item | type=term | hint=item category]]
>
> **GM Note:** The moon paper figurine is imbued with the spirituality of the moon domain and is a time-sensitive extraordinary item, so it can be used by others.

### Dark Gaze

- **Cost:** **Casting action**; 3 points of **spirituality**. [[LINK LATER: Casting Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
- **Targeting and range:** One target within line of sight.
- **Effect:**
  - Use your own naked eyes as a substitute for others, affecting the target within your line of sight.
  - Mysteriously attack the opponent’s [[LINK LATER: Will Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]]; then the target establishes contact with you, which is regarded as entering a **Substitute State**. [[LINK LATER: Substitute State | type=mechanic | hint=state created by Dark Gaze]]
  - This is a temporary curse that can be dispelled; it can also be dispelled automatically when leaving the battlefield. [[LINK LATER: Dispel | type=mechanic | hint=removing curses/effects]]
- **In the Substitute State (called “avatar state” in the RAW):** [[UNCLEAR: The RAW uses both “substitute state” and “avatar state” without explicitly stating they are the same state.]]
  - **Obscuration**
    - **Use:** Free action; continued obscuration costs you an action each turn.
    - **Effect:** The target blocked by you is regarded as blind from the perspective of both the enemy and the enemy. Unless there are other means to distinguish position, the enemy and the enemy continue to be disadvantaged. [[LINK LATER: Blind | type=condition | hint=vision-impaired condition]] [[UNCLEAR: The phrase “both the enemy and the enemy” is duplicative/self-contradictory and the intended affected sides are unclear.]]
  - **Crushing**
    - **Use:** **Attack action.** [[LINK LATER: Attack Action | type=mechanic | hint=action type]]
    - **Effect (self):** You crush one of your eyeballs, taking 5d6 damage instantly.
    - **Effect (ongoing self):** You continue to lose 1 action and unlimited free actions each turn until the eyeball is restored, or the eyeball restores itself after the battle.
      - If both of your eyes are crushed, you are continuously blinded and have only 1 action and 1 free action per round.
      - For the Witch King, the crushed eyeball must be fully regenerated after an encounter, and can only be regenerated after the encounter.
    - **Effect (foe):** Your foe immediately suffers: “Your damage” +4d6+5 **Hard Damage** (ignores any normal means of armor, doubles, and damage reduction). [[LINK LATER: Hard Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type that ignores protections]] [[LINK LATER: Armor | type=mechanic | hint=protection/defense]] [[LINK LATER: Doubles | type=mechanic | hint=substitute/double rules]] [[LINK LATER: Damage Reduction | type=mechanic | hint=reducing incoming damage]] [[UNCLEAR: “Your damage” is not defined (what base value it refers to) and may depend on rules outside this section.]]

### Moon Rituals

- **Cost:** 10 **spirituality** points; 5-minute ritual process. [[LINK LATER: Ritual | type=mechanic | hint=ritual process rules]]
- **Use:** Must be performed under moonlight; only once every 24 hours.
- **Effect:**
  - You directly borrow power from the “moon.” This is a ritual magic that can only be mastered by a Witch King.
  - When the ritual is completed, the Witch King’s all attributes +1.
  - At the same time, [[LINK LATER: Lunar Knowledge | type=term | hint=knowledge/skill level]] gains an additional skill level:
    - This does not affect the identification of Lunar Knowledge.
    - All abilities that calculate benefits based on the number of Lunar Knowledge levels calculate one more skill level, and gain one extra benefit.
  - This benefit lasts for one hour.
- **Example:** In this state, the moon double gains an extra double because of the extra skill level. [[LINK LATER: Moon Double | type=ability | hint=ability benefiting from Lunar Knowledge levels]]
- **Sequence 3 note:** Change to an extra level of knowledge for two months. [[LINK LATER: Sequence 3 | type=sequence | hint=referenced duration change for Moon Rituals]]

### Illusionary Bat Swarm

- **Cost:** **Free action.**
- **Effect:**
  - Your body disintegrates and collapses into a group of vampire bats between reality and illusion; you gain the ability to fly. [[LINK LATER: Flight | type=mechanic | hint=fly movement]]
  - Each bat has 1 hit point equal to your current hit points. [[LINK LATER: Hit Points | type=mechanic | hint=HP]] [[UNCLEAR: “Each bat has 1 hit point equal to your current hit points” is internally inconsistent and may rely on missing swarm rules.]]
  - Your movement speed is multiplied by 2. [[LINK LATER: Movement Speed | type=mechanic | hint=speed stat]]
  - In this state, unless all bats are killed, you can regroup; this state cannot be hit hard. [[UNCLEAR: “Cannot be hit hard” is undefined (likely refers to Hard Damage or a specific rules term).]]
  - The swarm is considered as a whole:
    - The bats formed cannot act alone.
    - Their minds are synchronized with you; you do not gain extra actions from this.
    - There is no difference between single-target and area-of-effect damage.
- **Special:**
  - You may separate only one or a small number of bats from your body and order them to do simple tasks instead of you (e.g., delivering letters, finding items, transporting goods).
  - In normal form, once per day, when your hit points become 0, you immediately recover 2d6 hit points, then immediately convert the remaining hit points into a swarm of bats and flee in all directions. If the heart is pierced to death, this cannot be recovered.
- **Sequence 3 note:** Part of your bat can answer prayers in your place. [[LINK LATER: Answer Prayers | type=mechanic | hint=prayer/response effect]] [[LINK LATER: Sequence 3 | type=sequence | hint=referenced enhancement for bat swarm]]

- **Special judgment on “batization”:**
  - In bat state, you cannot use the [[LINK LATER: Claws of Corrosion | type=ability | hint=restricted in bat state]] or perform normal fighting attacks, but you can still use other spells.
  - Fighting is changed to life sucking; this is divided into non-consumption of spirituality and consumption of spirituality. [[LINK LATER: Fighting | type=mechanic | hint=attack/skill check term]]
  - **Does not consume spirituality:**
    - You turn into a bat and rush to wrap the opponent.
    - The casting action is changed to an attack action.
    - Test: fighting against physical defense. [[LINK LATER: Physical Defense | type=mechanic | hint=defense stat]]
    - Damage: curse damage equal to 1d3 + Strength damage dice. [[LINK LATER: Curse Damage | type=mechanic | hint=damage type]]
    - Healing: recover 1d6 hit points.
    - This method cannot produce additional potions; you only gain the benefits of dealing damage and restoring hit points. [[LINK LATER: Potions | type=item | hint=created by life-sucking variant]]
  - **Consumption of spirituality (two types):**
    1. You do not pounce to use melee attacks; instead, you summon black mist from a distance to form additional bats. These bats cause normal life-sucking effects, using the casting action like the original ability.
    2. You pounce and use a close-range attack (still an attack action), tested as fighting against physical defense:
       - Damage: 3d6 + Strength damage dice of curse damage.
       - Healing: restore 1d6 blood volume.
       - This creates additional potions, which can be taken immediately when bat-formed or temporarily kept in an empty bottle when transformed back into human form (only one can be kept at most). [[LINK LATER: Empty Bottle | type=item | hint=container for storing a potion]]

> **Lore:** In expression, you can have yourself rush out from the depths of darkness in the form of a bat swarm, immediately envelop a target, accompanied by the sound of flapping wings and the scream of the target, swallow the target alive, and turn it into a mummified corpse within three seconds; after you recover your human form, you can wipe the corners of your mouth as if you have had a full meal.

> **GM Note:** At this stage, the Witch King of Sequence 4 is already considered a leader in the field of darkness and moon magic, but because the original book does not have more dark magic, the extension of dark and moon magic is left to the actual **GM** and **Player** to draw up by themselves. To put it simply, extraordinary people can draw up some dark magic by themselves and execute it after the **GM** approves it; it should not be too strong or too weak. You can refer to the original dark or moon magic for creation. As a standard, no more than three kinds of original dark magic are recommended; otherwise, it may cause uncontrollable variables, and the content and ideas should be concise and clear.
