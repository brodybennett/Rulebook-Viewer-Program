# Sequence 8: Barbarians

> **Lore:** Problems that cannot be solved by law must be dealt with force; force is also a kind of rule.

## Advancement

### Auxiliary Materials

- **Main Materials:** a stalk of crazy grass; solid unicorn crystal of the earth rhinoceros
- **Auxiliary Materials:** one deep-grained walnut; one lemon balm; 10ml of pure dew soaked from poplar bark; 100ml of spirits

## Extraordinary Abilities

### Attribute Gain

- **Attribute Gain:** Strength +2; Constitution +1; Agility +1; Will +2
- **Skill Gain:** Fighting +1 level; Climbing +1 level; Survival +1 level

### Skill Growth Through Violence

- When you face a problem that is:
  - non-repetitive, and
  - challenging, and
  - cannot be resolved by law,
  and you begin to resort to violence and **successfully solve** the matter (regardless of the outcome), choose one:
  - Fighting
  - a Fighting subdivision
  - Climbing
  - Survival  
  Increase the chosen skill by 1 level.
- This does not include bullying.
- “Challenging” means you tried to rely on the law, but the matter was beyond what the law can handle.
- Each skill can be quickly upgraded to **Proficient** at most.
- The number of growths (not just promotions) is equal to Sequence 9.  
  [[UNCLEAR: “the number of growths … is equal to Sequence 9” references an undefined limit and cannot be resolved from this section alone.]]

### Law of Wildness

- For Barbarians, power is also a kind of rule—another rule besides law.

1. Gain a beneficial +2 to Strength-related skills and [[LINK LATER: Attribute Identification | type=mechanic | hint=the check used to identify attributes]]; Fighting damage increases by +1d6. This is described as being enough to blow the wall out of “spider web” traces with one punch and make the building tremble. [[LINK LATER: Spider Web | type=mechanic | hint=the “spider web” traces mentioned here]]
2. Gain [[LINK LATER: Fast Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=evasion/defense feature]]; maintain complete physical defense against firearms, excluding light and lightning; and gain +1 **Dodge** level. [[UNCLEAR: “complete physical defense against firearms, excluding light and lightning” is unclear about what is excluded and how it applies.]] [[LINK LATER: Dodge | type=mechanic | hint=dodge levels and their effects]] [[LINK LATER: Firearms | type=item | hint=ranged weapons category]]
3. Whenever you look for water, food, or other survival resources in a primitive or social environment, gain a beneficial +2 to [[LINK LATER: Survival Identification | type=mechanic | hint=the check used to identify survival resources]].

> **GM Note:** “Survival resources” must be direct materials (excluding written materials) and may include various animals and creatures. The definition is broad: you may search for a species (including humans) and identify whether food is edible.

> **GM Note:** This effect is brought by the potion and cannot be stolen or recorded.

### Mental Resistance

- You have fairly high resistance to mental influences.
- Whenever your **Sanity** is deducted [[LINK LATER: Sanity | type=term | hint=the character’s sanity value]]:
  - Reduce the deducted Sanity value by 1 (treat it as “-1”).
  - The deduction cannot be reduced below 0.
- Example: If you suffer a Sanity loss of **1/1d3**, you lose 1 Sanity on a successful [[LINK LATER: Sanity Loss Test | type=mechanic | hint=the check referenced by “sanity loss test”]] and 1d3 Sanity on a failure. With this ability:
  - On a success: 1 − 1 = 0 (no Sanity loss).
  - On a failure: 1d3 − 1 Sanity.

> **GM Note:** This effect is brought by the potion and cannot be stolen or recorded. See [[LINK LATER: Madness and Loss of Control | type=rule | hint=rules section describing sanity loss]] for details on Sanity loss.
