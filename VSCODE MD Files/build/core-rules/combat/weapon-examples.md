### Shotgun Special Rules {#weapon-examples-shotgun-special-rules}

Special: hunting guns / shotguns are the same category.

- If the Roll result > the target’s **Physical Defense** (not counting Agility (DEX) Dodge), even if the Roll fails it still deals half damage.

- Within 5 meters:
  - Damage doubles (round up).
  - Ignore Armor by 3 points.
- If Ignore Armor exceeds the target’s **Armor**, the excess becomes a Damage Bonus.

### Explosives {#weapon-examples-explosives}

Explosives generally require the Throwing Skill to take effect; they are one-time consumables.

9. **Fragmentation Grenade:** 2d6 explosive damage.
   - Ignore Armor by 2 points; excess becomes a Damage Bonus.
   - Affects a 5-meter radius.

16. **Coastal Defense Cannon:** 5d6 explosive damage; range 20,000 meters.
   - Otherwise the same as shells.

**Note:** “Bullet damage” and “explosive damage” are both physical damage in substance; they are just different intuitive labels.

Firearms / shells: all can ignore the Agility (DEX) and Dodge components in the target’s Physical Defense value, not including targets with [[MISSING REF: Quick Dodge]].

> **GM Note:** Shotguns usually require a hunting license to own, which usually requires the character to be at least reputation-proficient. Steam rifles can only be held by the military and the Steam Church; even police/official/background ownership may still involve illegal possession of firearms. If caught by the police, you will likely end up in a public security court unless you stated in advance that you picked it up and have sufficient reasons to prove why you might have gunpowder residue on you.

## Armor {#weapon-examples-armor}

**Armor** is used to resist damage and protect vital points; armor is made of different materials.

1. **Padded Armor / Leather Armor:**

   - 2 points of physical **Damage Reduction**
   - Destroyed after taking fire damage twice
2. **Chainmail / Iron Armor:**
   - 4 Armor

   - Agility (DEX) temporarily -4
   - If Strength (STR) is under 10: Movement speed is halved (round up)

> **Lore:** Military/royal enchanted full armor is generally deep black with a metallic sheen. It is usually worn by the military/royal “Punishment Knights” when performing long-distance escort/guard missions, generally appearing in situations involving ironclad ships/war; it will not appear in other situations. (It is generally not seen in the center of a city / protecting unimportant persons / unimportant objects / performing city-internal work.)
