# Spirituality and Beyonder Abilities {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities}

This section covers recovery for **Spirituality**, **Vitality**, and **Sanity / Rationality** after exertion and injury.

> **GM Note:** After a fierce battle, characters will often have heavily reduced Spirituality and some Vitality loss; in special circumstances, Sanity / Rationality can also be exhausted into madness. Small differences in remaining Spirituality can significantly change the direction of a session.

## Spirituality Recovery {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-spirituality-recovery}

**Spirituality** recovers through sleep, meditation, or other **sufficient rest**.

- During sufficient rest, you cannot engage in intense exercise:
  - You may walk.
  - You cannot run, fight, or hunt enemies.

- **8 hours** of sufficient rest fully restores your Spirituality.
- If you rest **less than 8 hours**:
  - Each hour restores **one-eighth of your Spirituality maximum**, **rounded down**.

- For a rest period **shorter than 1 hour**:
  - If the shortfall is **within 5 minutes**, the **GM** may decide it is approximately equal to **1 hour**.
  - If the shortfall is **more than 5 minutes**, but you have already rested for **half an hour**, the recovery is **half of one-eighth** of your Spirituality maximum.
  - [[UNCLEAR: Spirituality recovery for rests under 30 minutes (and more than 5 minutes short of 1 hour) is not specified.]]

**Warning:** If your Spirituality is emptied, and **Beyonder** abilities continue to be forcibly used, it begins to consume your **Sanity / Rationality**.

**Special (example: [[Night Pathway]]):** Some effects reduce the rest duration needed for full Spirituality recovery. In such cases:
- Each hour restores **(total Spirituality / maximum rest time)**.
- Example: if **3 hours** of sufficient rest is the maximum rest time, you restore **one-third** per hour.
- [[UNCLEAR: “Maximum rest time” and rounding for this formula are not defined here.]]

## Vitality Recovery {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-vitality-recovery}

### Requirements {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-vitality-recovery-requirements}

**Vitality** recovery requires sufficient recuperation (not necessarily sleep/meditation), and the injury must be properly handled.

- To recover Vitality, your wounds must have:
  - received corresponding medical treatment,
  - been medically handled and cared for,
  - and been protected from worsening or secondary injury.

> **GM Note:** Healing time references: ordinary wounds often take **1–2 weeks**; moderate injuries **1 month**; fractures and similar injuries **3 months**.

### Recovery Rate {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-vitality-recovery-rate}

- If the wound has undergone **1 successful Medicine Roll** treatment:
  - Every **12 hours**, recover Vitality equal to your **Constitution (CON)**.
- If the wound has **not** undergone a Medicine Roll treatment:
  - Every **12 hours**, recover Vitality equal to **half** of your Constitution (CON), **rounded down**.

### Medicine Difficulty Values {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-medicine-difficulty-values}

**Medicine Roll** Difficulty Values for different injuries:

1. **Minor injury** (abrasion / torso bleeding / rib fracture / injuries where you can still barely move): **Difficulty Value 10**
2. **Moderate injury** (flesh torn open / a limb with large-area damage / moderate fracture): **Difficulty Value 15**
3. **Severe injury** (near death / paralysis of the lower body / large-area full-body damage): **Difficulty Value 20**

**Reference for Vitality loss (injury severity):**
- Minor injury: loses **within half** of total Vitality.
- Moderate injury: loses **more than half**, **rounded down**.
- Severe injury: near-death state, or remaining Vitality is **less than 2** points.

### Continued Treatment {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-continued-treatment}

1. A successful **Medicine Roll** can only allow the patient to recover Vitality equal to **Constitution (CON)** **within 24 hours**.  
   After **24 hours**, you should make **1 more** successful Medicine Roll (for changing medicine / re-bandaging); otherwise, it reverts to only recovering **half** of Constitution (CON) per **12 hours**.  
   [[UNCLEAR: This “CON per 24 hours” limit appears to conflict with “every 12 hours recover Vitality equal to CON.”]]

2. For **ordinary people**, with **moderate injury / severe injury / fractures**:
   - The **first** Medicine Roll cannot restore Vitality; it can only prevent the situation from worsening.
   - You must be in a hospital with a suitable medical environment (or similar), then make **1 more** successful Medicine Roll to restore Vitality.

3. For **Beyonders**:
   - Only **severe injuries** require the special treatment in (2).
   - **Sequence 4 and above** Beyonders do not need special treatment. (See [[Chapter 10: Sequences]].)
   - (Even so, for a Beyonder to gain this benefit, within their Sequence there must be some Sequence level that provides a **Constitution (CON)** increase.)
   - [[UNCLEAR: It is not specified which part of (3) is gated by the “Sequence level that provides a CON increase” condition.]]

### Poison and Toxins {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-poison-and-toxins}

- Poison damage without external wounds must be handled by taking medicine that can deal with toxins.
- If the medicine taken is a **Beyonder** medicine, **no Medicine Roll** is needed.
- If it is an ordinary medicine, replace the Medicine Roll with a **Constitution (CON) Roll** of the corresponding Difficulty Value.
- (The Witch’s plague is calculated separately in the corresponding Sequence description: [[MISSING REF: Witch’s plague]].)

## Sanity / Rationality Recovery {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-sanity-rationality-recovery}

There are multiple channels to recover **Sanity / Rationality**. Common ones include psychological guidance, sufficient rest, and entertainment.

You may use methods (1), (2), and (3) within the same 24 hours (recovering a total of **3** points). The 24-hour limits are tracked **independently** for each method.

### Psychological Guidance {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-psychological-guidance}

- Set the Difficulty Value to: **10 + the total Sanity / Rationality you have lost**.
- Each time you receive at least **2 hours** of psychotherapy:
  - The Psychiatrist treating you makes **1** psychological guidance Roll against that Difficulty Value.
  - On success, you recover **1** point of Sanity / Rationality.
- You may attempt multiple times until success, but you can only recover **once per 24 hours** this way.
- Special: For [[MISSING REF: Spectator Pathway]] Beyonders, psychotherapy time is **1 hour**; starting at **Sequence 7** it is **half an hour**.

### Rest {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-sanity-rest}

- If you take **8 hours** of sufficient rest, you recover **1** point of Sanity / Rationality.
- If less than **8 hours**, you may make up sleep within **12 hours**.
- After you gain this recovery, you cannot gain it again within **24 hours**.

### Entertainment {#spirituality-and-beyonder-abilities-sanity-entertainment}

- If you engage in at least **2 hours** of entertainment behavior, you recover **1** point of Sanity / Rationality.
- The entertainment depends on your values, but it must bring sufficient happiness.
- Limited to recovering **once per 24 hours**.
