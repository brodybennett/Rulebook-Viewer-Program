# Acting {#becoming-a-beyonder-acting}

**Acting** is a method for digesting a potion and mastering its power. See also: [[Acting Method and Digestion]].

## Learning the Acting Method {#acting-learning-the-acting-method}

A low-**Sequence** wild **Beyonder** usually has no way to know the **Acting Method**. Even official **Sequence** 9–7 Beyonders are usually the same.

> **GM Note:** If a character is in a tier where Acting matters, they must find a way to learn the Acting Method to digest their potion effectively—or you may establish (in their backstory) the channel through which they learned it.

## What Acting Is {#acting-what-is-acting}

**Acting** means: based on the performance implied by the potion’s name, you place yourself into that role to align with the power the potion brings.

Examples:
- A **Sequence** 7 Psychiatrist helps others with psychological treatment.
- A **Sequence** 9 Seer goes to places like divination clubs to help others with divination.

During Acting, you must act immersively to gain recognition from the Beyonder characteristics within you—this is the essence of Acting—but you must not forget that **“you are only acting.”**

> **GM Note:** If you truly treat the acted identity as yourself, you are very likely to gradually fall into the abyss of Loss of Control.

## Digestion Percentage {#acting-digestion-percentage}

**Digestion %** is the potion progress gradually mastered through Acting.

- **Cap:** The Digestion % of a single potion can reach at most **20**.
- **After advancement:** After each advancement, if you did not **Act in Advance**, the potion’s initial Digestion % is **1**.

### Digestion Benefits {#acting-digestion-benefits}

For every **5** points of Digestion %:
- Your **Vitality** maximum **+1**
- Your **Spirituality** maximum **+1**

Potions of repeated **Sequence** levels are not counted.

### Potion Fully Digested {#acting-potion-fully-digested}

When a potion is fully digested:
- An illusory shattering sound rings beside your ears.
- You feel something within your body dissolving and merging with your mind.

This confirms you have completely digested the potion.

## Increasing Digestion % {#acting-increasing-digestion}

There are two ways to increase a Beyonder’s Acting progress.

### Daily Acting {#acting-daily-acting}

**Daily Acting** means consistently performing the role implied by your potion (e.g., a “Faceless” constantly performing a persona not belonging to their original identity, or a Psychiatrist constantly providing daily treatment).

Gain **+1 Digestion %** for each period of Daily Acting:

- **Sequence 9:** every **1 week**
- **Sequence 8:** every **2 weeks**
- **Sequence 7:** every **1 month**
- **Sequence 6:** every **3 months**
- **Sequence 5:** every **half a year**
- **Sequence 4:** every **1 year**
- **Sequence 3:** every **3 years**
- **Sequence 2:** every **6 years**
- **Sequence 1:** every **15 years**

(Sequence 0 is still judged as **Sequence 1** for this purpose, because Sequence 0 is essentially digesting three portions of Sequence 1 characteristics; however, the characteristics that need to be digested are obviously more than one portion.)

### Decisive Acting Feedback {#acting-decisive-acting-feedback}

**Decisive Acting Feedback** usually means you completed something related to Acting that is difficult and gains recognition—such as:
- others’ recognition,
- summarized precise Acting rules,
- broad recognition from others,
- acknowledgement from one Beyonder of higher Rank than you, or from multiple Beyonders higher by **Sequence** level.

Apply the result to the potion matching your Acting name:

- If you are normally doing **Daily Acting**: increase Digestion % by **1d6** each time you complete a decisive Acting.
- If you are not normally doing **Daily Acting**: increase Digestion % by **1d4** each time.

## Acting in Advance {#acting-acting-in-advance}

You can **Act in Advance** for a future potion/role.

- Example: A **Sequence** 9 Seer can Act in Advance for **Sequence** 6 Faceless.
- After you advance to that **Sequence**, you directly inherit the Digestion % you gained from Acting in Advance.
- Digestion % gained from Acting in Advance **before** you truly advance grants **no benefits**.

Acting in Advance is slower:
- The Acting speed is **half** of formal Acting.
- Therefore:
  - For **Daily Acting**, double the required time.
  - For **Decisive Acting Feedback**:
    - **1d6 → 1d3**
    - **1d4 → 1d2**

## If You Do Not Act {#acting-no-acting}

If you are **not Acting at all**, the digestion time for Beyonder characteristics is:

- **Sequence 9:** +1 Digestion % every **2 months**
- **Sequence 8:** +1 Digestion % every **6 months**
- **Sequence 7:** +1 Digestion % every **10 months**
- **Sequence 6:** +1 Digestion % every **2 years**
- **Sequence 5:** +1 Digestion % every **5 years**
- **Sequence 4:** +1 Digestion % every **20 years**
- **Sequence 3:** +1 Digestion % every **40 years**
- **Sequence 2:** +1 Digestion % every **80 years**
- **Sequence 1:** +1 Digestion % every **200 years**

The Digestion % benefits from not Acting **do not overlap** with Digestion % benefits from Acting.

- If you have already chosen to Act, you cannot gain Digestion % from not Acting.
- Example: If you Acted for 3 weeks, you do **not** also gain +1 Digestion % at the 2-month mark.
