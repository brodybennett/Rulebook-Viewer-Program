# Advancement {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement}

**Advancement** (becoming a **Beyonder**) requires preparing and consuming a **potion**.

A potion includes:
- a **main ingredient**
- **supplementary ingredients**

## Obtaining Potions {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-obtaining-potions}

Ways to obtain a potion:

1. **Recipe + self-preparation**
   - Obtain a potion recipe (e.g., at a Beyonder gathering or other channels).
   - Assemble the listed main ingredient and supplementary ingredients.
   - Use something like a boiler to boil the main ingredient into a liquid.
   - Add supplementary ingredients in sequence.
   - Bottle the finished potion.

2. **Finished potion (no recipe)**
   - Through special channels, obtain a finished potion directly (no recipe; skip collecting materials).
   - This is cheaper than method 1.
   - Generally, only forces unwilling to provide the recipe will do this.

3. **Consume the main ingredient directly (not a true potion)**
   - Directly consume the corresponding main ingredient / Beyonder characteristic, ignoring supplementary ingredients.
   - This is a high-risk gamble with a high chance of losing control.

### Official or Organization-Affiliated Channels {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-official-channels}

4. **Merits-based provision**
   - If you are an official Beyonder / affiliated with an organization:
     - After accumulating sufficient merits, you may apply for Advancement.
     - If you pass verification, you are generally provided (at the same time) with:
       - the recipe
       - the main and supplementary ingredients
     - The potion will be prepared in front of you, and you may even be assisted in Advancing.

5. **Restrictions of affiliation**
   - Many of your actions will be under the organization’s supervision.
   - Private Advancement is difficult to justify.
   - It is hard to separate from the organization again.
   - It is difficult to obtain an opportunity to Advance to a demigod.
   - Starting from demigod, only finished potions will be provided (no recipe or preparation process).

## Advancement Sanity / Rationality Check {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-sanity-rationality-check}

Once you drink a potion, you immediately suffer the corresponding negative effects within the Beyonder characteristic and must immediately make an **Advancement Sanity / Rationality check**.

### Check Procedure {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-check-procedure}

- Roll `rd20+20`.
- Oppose the result with your current Sanity / Rationality:
  - If the result is **＞** your current Sanity / Rationality: **failure**
  - If the result is **≤** your current Sanity / Rationality: **success**

> **GM Note:** Advancement has no critical failure / critical success; it is a special Sanity / Rationality check.

### Modifiers and Effects {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-check-modifiers}

Apply the following to the Advancement Sanity / Rationality check (and where noted, to final Sanity / Rationality loss):

1. For each 1 point of same-Sequence potion **Digestion %**: `-1` (favorable).  
   For each supplementary ingredient in the potion: additionally `-1`.
2. If you directly consume the main ingredient / Beyonder characteristic that has not been made into a potion: `+5` (unfavorable).
3. If the consumed main ingredient is a Beyonder characteristic, and your personality is similar to the Beyonder characteristic’s spiritual imprint: `-2` (favorable).
4. On the basis of (3), if your personality is opposite to the Beyonder characteristic’s spiritual imprint and they are difficult to mutually acknowledge: `+4` (unfavorable).
5. If you are in a madness state, the final Sanity / Rationality loss is increased by half (rounded up).
6. For each undigested potion in your body that is below your Sequence level: `+1` (unfavorable). Once fully digested, it does not count.  
   If the repeated potion you consumed is the same as your Sequence level, the unfavorable modifier for the Advancement check changes from `+20` to `+40` until digestion is complete.
7. A Beyonder of the same Sequence or higher can, via edicts / requiem / psychological suggestion, etc., create a better Advancement environment: `-2` (favorable).  
   For each Sequence level they are higher than you: additionally `-1` (favorable).  
   For each Rank they are higher: additionally `-2` (favorable).
8. On the basis of (7), if a Beyonder of higher Sequence can influence you, they may invert the effect of (5).  
   [[UNCLEAR: “invert the effect of (5)” does not specify the exact calculation.]]
9. Advancing under an astronomical phenomenon:
   - full moon: `-2` (favorable)
   - blood moon: `-4` (favorable)  
   This does not guarantee whether it will attract anomalies (especially the latter). This is calculated independently from (7) and does not benefit from Beyonder Sequence-level influence, including such summoned astronomical phenomena.
10. If the creature drinking the potion is a non-sapient animal: `+4` (unfavorable).

## Rituals and Followers {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-rituals-and-followers}

In Advancement requirements, the Sequence of the Advancement ritual is specified:

- If you do **not** perform an Advancement ritual: final Sanity / Rationality loss is multiplied by `2`.
- If you **do** perform an Advancement ritual: you gain `5` points of Sanity / Rationality protection, which can be deducted first from your Sanity / Rationality loss.

Starting from **Sequence 2**, Advancement involving followers:

- For every `1,000` followers you have: gain `1` point of Sanity / Rationality protection when Advancing.
- If you Advance **without** performing a ritual, this instead becomes: for every `5,000` followers you have, gain `1` point of Sanity / Rationality protection.

## Sanity / Rationality Loss by Target Sequence {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-loss-by-sequence}

Sanity / Rationality loss does not require a separate check. Use the result of your Advancement Sanity / Rationality check to determine success, then apply the corresponding loss.

| Sequence | Sanity / Rationality Loss (Success / Failure) |
|---:|:---|
| Sequence 9 | 0 / 1 |
| Sequence 8 | 1 / 1d2 |
| Sequence 7 | 1d2 / 1d4 |
| Sequence 6 | 1d4 / 1d8 |
| Sequence 5 | 1d6 / 1d12 |
| Sequence 4 | 1d8 / 2d8 |
| Sequence 3 | 1d10 / 2d10 |
| Sequence 2 | 2d6 / 2d12 |
| Sequence 1 | 2d8 / 3d10 |
| Sequence 0 | 2d10 / 3d12 |

Apply any protection and multipliers (e.g., ritual protection, followers, madness-state adjustments) to determine final Sanity / Rationality loss.

## Final Advancement Results {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-final-results}

If you lose:
- `3` points of Sanity / Rationality during Advancement: enter a **semi-loss-of-control state**
- `5` points of Sanity / Rationality during Advancement: enter a **loss-of-control / death state**

If you Advance while already in a semi-loss-of-control state, treat it as having already lost `3` points of Sanity / Rationality.

### Semi-Loss-of-Control State {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-semi-loss-of-control}

Immediately make 1 Willpower (WIL) check with DC `15`.

- **Success:** You Advance successfully.
- **Failure:** Make another Sanity / Rationality check to determine additional loss (`1` / `1d2`):
  1. Roll `rd20` opposed by your current Sanity / Rationality:
     - `≤` current Sanity / Rationality: success → lose `1`
     - `＞` current Sanity / Rationality: failure → lose `1d2`
     - If this additional loss brings total loss to `5` points, enter [[Loss-of-Control / Death State]].
  2. This Sanity / Rationality check (limited to the semi-loss-of-control state) still enjoys all benefits from Advancement influences (1)(2)(3)(4)(5)(6)(7)(8)(9).

See also: [[Madness and Losing Control]].

### Loss-of-Control / Death State {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-loss-of-control-death}

Make another Willpower (WIL) check with DC `20`.

- **Success:** You become an advancement-failed Beyonder; see [[MISSING REF: Expansion 5: Beyonders in Special States]].
- **Failure:** Roll `1d2`:
  - on `1`: you lose control
  - on `2`: you die

### Advancement Success {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-success}

You become the corresponding Beyonder and can independently use your Beyonder abilities.

Within `72` hours, you exhibit **Spirituality overflow**:
- Spirit Vision can detect that you are a newly Advanced Beyonder.
- Checks for your newly gained abilities suffer a continuing `-2` (unfavorable).

## Repeated Consumption of Potions {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-repeated-consumption}

In some cases, a Beyonder may consume multiple repeated potions. On this basis, repeated potions bring the following benefits and drawbacks:

1. **1 repeated potion:** Beyonder ability checks / escape difficulty in that potion’s corresponding Sequence level are `+2` (favorable).
2. **2 repeated potions:** Beyonder abilities in that potion’s corresponding Sequence level increase in strength by `1` Sequence level.  
   When the benefit of the next Sequence is not marked / involves a gap in Rank (e.g., Sequence 5 to Sequence 4), the relevant benefit is decided by the GM.
   - Example: Consuming 2 repeated Marionettist potions does not mean you are equivalent to Sequence 4, but it might increase the puppet limit by `1–2`.
3. **3 or more repeated potions:** The relevant benefits are decided by the GM (e.g., more favorable modifiers, reduction of negative effects, increased ability limits, etc.).

> **GM Note:** Limit the strength of repeated consumption. Repeated potions have more drawbacks than benefits and are a digestion burden on the Beyonder. For example, even consuming 10 potions should not make every strike a critical success.

## Pathway Jump {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-pathway-jump}

With Sequence 5 advancing to Sequence 4 as the node, most pathways can choose to stop advancing the current pathway and instead advance an adjacent pathway.

Exception: the Seer, Thief, and Apprentice pathways can only jump when advancing from Sequence 4 to Sequence 3.

### Ability Retention and Mutations {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-jump-retention-mutation}

1. **Ability retention**
   - All Beyonder abilities of the original pathway are retained.
   - The original-pathway abilities do not improve to the next Sequence tier and remain forever at that tier.
   - Even so, if a Sequence 4 Beyonder attacks using an ability from their former Sequence 5, that ability still benefits from Rank suppression effects and is treated as a demigod.

2. **Ability mutation**
   - If two potions of the same Sequence level but different pathways coexist within a Beyonder’s body, they mutate into more bizarre, difficult-to-guard-against effects.
   - Example: A Death pathway Sequence 5 demigod who switches to Night pathway Sequence 4—his dream-entry may gain an additional effect that causes those sleeping in the dream to die without realizing it (discuss with the GM).
   - Generally, the number of abilities whose effects are combined should not exceed the number of potions that are the same Sequence level but different pathways. Repeated potions do not count.
     - Example: If you consumed two sets of Sequence 9–5 potions, then consuming one set again does not produce more mutations—unless you then jump to a third pathway, resulting in three sets of potions of different pathways in your body.

### Jump Count and Illegal Jumps {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-jump-limits}

1. **Jump count**
   - The number of Pathway Jumps is not limited to 1.
   - You can jump Seer → Apprentice → Thief → back to Seer.
   - However, undigested potions in your body may increase in multiples and may affect your Advancement; see [[Advancement Sanity / Rationality Check]].

2. **Forcible non-adjacent jumps or unmet conditions**
   - Forcibly jumping to a non-adjacent pathway, or not meeting the jump conditions, inevitably causes you to become half-mad.
   - You lose the opportunity for further Advancement.
   - Any subsequent Advancement will inevitably lose control; see [[MISSING REF: Expansion 5: Beyonders in Special States]].

### Lower-Sequence Benefits After a Jump {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-jump-lower-seq-benefits}

After a Pathway Jump, you can gain all benefits brought by the new pathway’s lower-Sequence potions, including attribute increases and skill levels.

- If an attribute/skill increase duplicates an increase you already gained in your original pathway, it cannot be increased again.
- Example: Corpse Collector 9–5 increases Intuition (INT) by a total of `6`. If you jump to the Night pathway:
  - if Night 9–5 total Intuition does not exceed `6`, Intuition cannot increase
  - if it exceeds `6`, Intuition can increase up to the corresponding value

### Missing Lower-Sequence Characteristics {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-jump-missing-lower-seq}

When the characteristic used for the Pathway Jump does not include lower-Sequence characteristics:

1. If the Beyonder characteristic (main ingredient) used for the Pathway Jump does not include lower-Sequence Beyonder characteristics (e.g., you consume a Sequence 4 switching-pathway Beyonder characteristic, but it does not include the Sequence 9–5 characteristics), the abilities you gain are incomplete.
   - Example: You can only gain the Sequence 4 abilities. However, if a certain ability of this pathway receives an enhancement at Sequence 4, you can gain that ability’s initial, unenhanced version until you later consume the corresponding lower-Sequence potions back.

2. A Pathway Jump is only upward-compatible; it cannot be at the same tier or downward.
   - You can accommodate lower-Sequence pathway characteristics for which you already have the corresponding higher-Sequence characteristics.

### Interchangeable Pathway List {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-interchangeable-pathways}

1. **Lord of the Mysteries**: Three Pathways  
   *(Note: only these three pathways can interchange when advancing from Sequence 4 to Sequence 3)*
   1. Seer (The Fool)
   2. Apprentice (Door)
   3. Error

2. **Omniscient and Omnipotent**: Five Pathways
   1. Storm
   2. Sun
   3. Spectator (Visionary)
   4. Hanged Man
   5. Reader (White Tower)

3. **Calamity**: Two Pathways
   1. Demoness
   2. Red Priest

4. **River of Eternal Darkness**: Three Pathways
   1. Night (Darkness)
   2. Death
   3. War God (Twilight Giant)

5. **Nation of Disorder**: Two Pathways
   1. Black Emperor
   2. Justiciar

6. **Knowledge Itself**: Two Pathways
   1. Mystery Pryer (Hermit)
   2. Paragon

7. **Desire**: Two Pathways
   1. Mutant (Chained)
   2. Abyss

8. **Life**: Two Pathways
   1. Moon
   2. Earth (Mother)

9. **Key of Light**: Single Pathway
   1. Fate

[[UNCLEAR: The text says the names in parentheses are “aliases for Sequence names,” but the parentheses here appear to function as common aliases for the listed names.]]

> **Lore:** Fate has no adjacent pathway that can interchange—alone and solitary.

### Hidden Interchange and Old One Restriction {#becoming-a-beyonder-advancement-hidden-interchange}

One hidden interchange:
- The Calamity two pathways (Demoness, Red Priest) can interchange with the River of Eternal Darkness three pathways (Night, Death, War God); they are adjacent pathways.

However:
- If you jump between Calamity-related pathways and River of Eternal Darkness-related pathways, unless you extract your previous characteristics, you cannot become an Old One.

> **Lore:** The specific reason is not explained here.
