# Spirit Vision {#spirit-vision}

**Spirit Vision** is a special sight possessed by every **Beyonder**. Its strength and any additional effects depend on the user's **Pathway** and **Sequence** level.

> **GM Note:** Any Pathway-specific upgrades to Spirit Vision appear in that Pathway’s Sequence entries.

## Activation {#spirit-vision-activation}

- **Action:** Spend **1 free action** to activate Spirit Vision. (See [[Special Actions]].)
- **Required switch:** Before using it, you must decide a personal **suggestion switch** (a consistent cue that “turns it on”), such as:
  - pinching the space between your eyebrows, or
  - lightly tapping your teeth.

## General Effects {#spirit-vision-effects}

While Spirit Vision is active, you can:

- **See weak spirits**, including **ghosts** and **wraiths**.
  - Ghosts dispersed for more than **1 day** are usually difficult to see.
- **See auras** on people as various colors.
  - By the aura’s **thickness**, **brightness**, and **color**, you can roughly judge the target’s **health** and **emotional state**.
  - Characters from Pathway with poor **Inspiration** are generally unable to distinguish these details clearly.

## Maintenance Cost {#spirit-vision-maintenance}

- Each round you maintain Spirit Vision, you consume **1 Spirituality**. (See [[Spirituality and Beyonder Abilities]].)
- Because of this ongoing cost, Spirit Vision should be used with restraint and turned off in time.

## Not the Same as Other Special Sights {#spirit-vision-not-equivalent}

Some special sights are **not** Spirit Vision (for example, “Spirit Body Threads” vision).

- Such special sights require their own separate **suggestion switch**.
- They are not equivalent to Spirit Vision.

## Mysticism Reference: What Spirit Vision “Shows” {#spirit-vision-mysticism-reference}

Anything with Spirituality can usually be seen in Spirit Vision as a unique color. Many things possess Spirituality, including:

- ordinary creatures,
- potion materials,
- Beyonder items.

> **Lore:** Some mysticism traditions classify what you see into the Spirit Body, Astral Body, Mental Body, and Etheric Body.

If an adventure requires detailed interpretation using Spirit Vision, use the references below.

### Spirit Body {#spirit-vision-spirit-body}

- Represents a person’s most fundamental Spirituality.
- “All things have spirit” traditions hold that all living beings have Spirituality and therefore a Spirit Body.
- Meditation and methods of increasing power ultimately point toward the Spirit Body.

### Astral Body {#spirit-vision-astral-body}

- The way the Spirit Body communicates with the spirit world and the starry sky.
- An external manifestation of the Spirit Body, directly related to one’s will and current emotions.

> **Lore:** Scenes seen after ingesting a potion are images seen by the Astral Body wandering the spirit world. This is connected to divination; the spirit world does not follow material rules, and past/present/future may overlap.

> **GM Note:** Only higher-Sequence Inspiration-type Pathway can directly see the Astral Body through Spirit Vision. The Eye of Secrets belongs to this type.

### Mental Body {#spirit-vision-mental-body}

- Unlike the other bodies, the Mental Body combines with the physical body.
- It concerns the mind: reasoning, thinking, insight, and ability to understand.

### Etheric Body {#spirit-vision-etheric-body}

- The outermost layer: life energy and physical state.
- The aura’s color is an external symbol of the Etheric Body.
- Through this, you can see some spirits, ghosts, and wraiths—including certain existences that should not be seen.
- You can judge health and emotional state through the aura’s thickness, brightness, and color as expressed by the Etheric Body.

## Etheric Body: Health Color Reference {#spirit-vision-etheric-health-colors}

The following colors are symbols of health:

1) **Hands, feet, and other movement-related areas:** red  
2) **Head and brain surface:** purple  
3) **Excretion and detoxification areas:** orange  
4) **Digestive system:** yellow  
5) **Outside the heart and regulation system:** green  
6) **Throat and part of the nervous system:** blue  
7) **Overall balance:** the body is shrouded in white  

If these become **dim**, **thinner**, or **shift in color**, the corresponding area indicates a problem and is in a fatigued or sick state.

## Astral Body: Emotion Color Reference {#spirit-vision-astral-emotion-colors}

Colors representing current emotions:

1) **Red:** passionate and excited  
2) **Orange:** warm and satisfied  
3) **Yellow:** happy and outgoing  
4) **Green:** calm and peaceful  
5) **Blue:** calm, in thought  
6) **White:** bright, positive, and upward  
7) **Dark:** depressed, sad, silent  
8) **Purple:** Spirituality is dominant; cold and distant
