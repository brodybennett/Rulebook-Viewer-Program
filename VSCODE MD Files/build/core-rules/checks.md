# Chapter 2: Checks {#chapter-2-checks}

## Making a Check {#chapter-2-checks-making-a-check}

A **Check** is made when an action’s outcome is uncertain.

- Roll: **1d20 + Attribute + Skills**
- If the total **exceeds** the **Difficulty Value**, the action succeeds.
- Otherwise, the action fails.

## Critical Results {#chapter-2-checks-critical-results}

A **Critical Success** occurs when the **d20** roll is **20**.  
A **Critical Failure** occurs when the **d20** roll is **1**.

- **Critical Success:** automatic success.
- **Critical Failure:** automatic failure.

For attack-related effects of a Critical Success, see [[Critical Success: Damage Minimum]].

### Critical Success: Damage Minimum {#chapter-2-checks-critical-success-damage-minimum}

> **GM Note:** A Critical Success does **not** make an attack deal maximum damage and does **not** add extra damage. It provides a guaranteed minimum.

After a Critical Success on an attack:
- The attack is guaranteed to hit.
- The attacker may roll the corresponding **Damage Check**.

Then determine the attack’s final damage using the rule below:

1. Determine the **Theoretical Maximum** of that Damage Check (the highest possible result of the damage roll).
2. Compute half of that Theoretical Maximum, **rounding up**.
3. If the rolled damage is **below** that rounded-up half, discard the rolled value and use the rounded-up half instead.
4. If the rolled damage is not below the minimum, use the rolled value.

Result: after a Critical Success, you deal **at least half** the Theoretical Maximum damage (rounding up), with no other benefits.

**Example:**  
- Damage Check: 1d8 + 5 → Theoretical Maximum = 13  
- Half of 13 = 6.5 → rounds up to **7**  
- If you roll 1d8 + 5 = 8, final damage is **8**.  
- If you roll 1d8 + 5 = 6, final damage is **7** (the guaranteed minimum).

### Critical Failure {#chapter-2-checks-critical-failure}

A Critical Failure usually results in the consequences of absolute failure.

> **GM Note:** The GM may apply corresponding additional penalties at their discretion.

## Difficulty Guidelines {#chapter-2-checks-difficulty-guidelines}

Difficulty Values commonly used as reference points:

- **10:** Something an ordinary person can do easily.
- **15:** A normal success, such as noticing a fairly important object.
- **20:** A difficult success, such as performing a gymnastics routine, or finding a slightly different stone on a beach with similar colors.
- **25:** An extremely difficult success—an unimaginable action, such as winning a gymnastics competition.
- **30:** An action that is almost impossible to accomplish.
