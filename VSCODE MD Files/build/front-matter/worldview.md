# Lord of the Mysteries Worldview {#worldview}

This section introduces the setting assumptions for Investigators who have not read the original *Lord of the Mysteries* novel.

- If you want a rules-first overview, see [[Beyonders in Play]].

## Purpose and Scope {#worldview-purpose-and-scope}

This setting can be played and enjoyed even if you do not know the novel. The goal is to provide enough context to understand what **Beyonders** are and how the supernatural fits into everyday life.

## Era and Aesthetic {#worldview-era-and-aesthetic}

On the surface, the world resembles Victorian-era Europe (especially Victorian Britain), before the Second Industrial Revolution.

- A useful shorthand for the overall feel is: Medieval + Victorian + Steampunk + Cthulhu + SCP Foundation.

> **Lore:** A flourishing age with deep inequality—wealth, nobility, and institutions endure while countless poor are exploited and disappear in dark corners. “It is the best of times, and it is the worst of times.”

## Gods and Faith {#worldview-gods-and-faith}

In this world, **God** exists in a literal sense.

- There are **seven orthodox Gods**.
  - They maintain their rationality.
  - Each country has churches and believers devoted to them.
- Gods outside the seven orthodox Gods are treated as **Hidden Existences**:
  - Gods of unknown background who cannot appear openly.
  - Commonly regarded as “evil gods.”

A deeper (in-setting blasphemous) truth is that Gods advance through **Sequences** and **Pathways**.

- **Sequence 0** is regarded as a true God.
- Some Gods began as ordinary people.
- In principle, you can ascend to the divine throne of **Sequence 0** by advancing along a **Pathway** of **Sequences**.

## The Beyonder System {#worldview-beyonder-system}

The supernatural is real, but it is hidden from ordinary society.

- Most ordinary people do not believe the supernatural exists.
- Many ordinary people treat the seven orthodox Gods as “religious beliefs” rather than provably real beings.
- By coincidence or circumstance, ordinary people may still come into contact with the Beyonder world and become **Beyonders**.

### Potions and Advancement {#worldview-potions-and-advancement}

In this setting, the primary way to gain supernatural power is through **Potions**.

- Drinking a **Potion** makes you a **Beyonder** and grants supernatural power.
- Advancement is achieved by continuing to drink Potions along a **Pathway** and rising through **Sequences**.
- By the mid-**Sequences**, advancement requires more than Potions:
  - You must also perform the corresponding ritual to advance successfully.

### Beyonder Characteristics {#worldview-beyonder-characteristics}

The essence of Potions is **Beyonder Characteristics** (boiled and prepared).

- **Beyonder Characteristics** are the source of all supernatural phenomena.

Cosmology (as presented here):

- A true **Creator** once existed.
- After the Creator fell, Their will and body split into countless **Beyonder Characteristics**.
- These Characteristics naturally merge into the environment:
  - Creatures that consume them become **Beyonder creatures**.
  - Objects they merge into become **Beyonder items**.

Humans do not usually consume Characteristics raw:

- A Potion is the act of consuming a **Beyonder Characteristic**, prepared with auxiliary materials to make it more stable.
- This stability helps prevent a human Beyonder from losing control due to the madness within.

### Madness and Losing Control {#worldview-madness-and-losing-control}

**Beyonder Characteristics** contain madness; the essence of the world is madness and chaos.

- Wild **Beyonder creatures** cannot make Potions.
  - After gaining Beyonder power, they become half-mad existences.
- Humans use Potions as a more stable method to obtain Beyonder power.
  - Gaining Beyonder abilities through Potions usually does not fall into madness.

Even so, the **Beyonder Characteristic** you drink is not yet truly “your own.”

- You must digest it and master it.
- If you do not, the unstable Characteristic within your body may cause you to lose control.

## Acting Method and Digestion {#worldview-acting-method-and-digestion}

To fully master a Potion’s power, you must **digest** the **Beyonder Characteristic**.

- **Acting** means acting according to the Potion’s name (the “Acting Method”).
- Acting is not strictly required for digestion, but it greatly increases digestion speed.

Examples:

- **Seer Pathway**, **Sequence 9** Potion (“Seer”):
  - Help people divine in daily life.
  - Take on the title of Seer and act as one.
- **Apothecary Pathway**, **Sequence 9** (“Apothecary”):
  - Act as an apothecary in daily life and help people heal.
- **Sequence 7** (“Spirit Medium”):
  - Leave others with the impression of a “Spirit Medium”: mysterious, hazy, with a hint of romance.

Digesting without Acting is extremely slow.

- A dose of a **Sequence 9** Potion, with no Acting at all, might take **a year** to digest completely.
- With successful Acting, it might take **a week or a month**.
- Higher-**Sequence** Potions require longer digestion time and therefore require Acting even more.

Practical limit (as described here):

- Those who do not know the Acting Method usually can only reach **Sequence 7**.
- **Sequence 6** is very likely the end of a lifetime.
- In ability mastery and state, they are inferior to Beyonders who have mastered the Acting Method.

## Death, Precipitation, and Assimilation {#worldview-death-precipitation-and-assimilation}

Because a Potion is essentially consuming a **Beyonder Characteristic**, a Beyonder’s death has consequences.

When a Beyonder (or Beyonder creature) is killed:

- The **Beyonder Characteristic** in their body will “precipitate out.”
- It slowly seeps out over about **5–10 minutes** and condenses together.

Each portion of **Beyonder Characteristic** retains part of the original owner’s will.

- If someone else uses the Characteristic from your death, their daily personality may gradually become you, unless the spiritual imprint in the Characteristic is removed.
- This “assimilation,” at higher **Sequences**, becomes “possession.”

At higher levels:

- A **demigod (Sequence 4)**, an **angel (Sequence 2)**, or an even higher existence usually does not truly die.
  - Even if they die, their spirit still exists.
  - They may possess the next person who consumes their Characteristic and return again.

### “Man-Eats-Man” Advancement {#worldview-man-eats-man-advancement}

A **Beyonder Characteristic** obtained by killing other Beyonders can directly replace a Potion’s main ingredient, because the essence of the main ingredient is simply a different **Beyonder Characteristic**.

In the era of the **Fifth Epoch** (the era the game is generally set in):

- Because **Beyonder creatures** have shown signs of being hunted to near-extinction, by the mid-**Sequences** there is another method of advancement:
  - “man-eats-man”—killing another Beyonder and consuming their **Beyonder Characteristic** to gain power.

## Sealed Artifacts and Containment {#worldview-sealed-artifacts-and-containment}

Mid-Sequence Beyonders usually do not leave too severe a spiritual imprint, unless:

- they died from losing control, or
- they died from corruption.

In those cases:

- Severe spiritual contamination remains within the **Beyonder Characteristic**.
- It is unusable before removal.
- A person who consumes such a Characteristic will not only face the chance of being possessed—
  - they may even lose control on the spot and become the next Beyonder who has lost control.

If such contaminated Characteristics eventually become **Beyonder items**, they can carry severe negative effects.

- **Sealed Artifacts** are **Beyonder items** with severe negative effects that can harm society and therefore need to be sealed.
- They are recovered and contained by official Beyonders, placed within churches, and are only used when necessary.

The seven major churches under the seven orthodox Gods:

- are responsible for Beyonder incidents in various places, and
- maintain specialized squads to contain harmful Beyonder items and keep them away from human society.

## Factions and Cults {#worldview-factions-and-cults}

Besides the seven major orthodox churches, there are cult organizations, including:

- “Rose School of Thought” (belief: “Mother Tree of Desire”)
- “Aurora Order” (belief: “True Creator”)
- “Demoness Sect” (belief: “Primordial Demoness”)

Ordinary people usually do not know of these cults or “evil gods,” and these beings are also regarded as **Hidden Existences**.

- The Aurora Order is an exception: because it is too flamboyant, many people know it as a terrorist organization that has carried out many terror activities.

## Themes {#worldview-themes}

> **Lore:** The world is not only about the supernatural. A central theme is the conflict between humanity and divinity. The Gods here are not all-knowing, all-powerful, or caring—and many unforgettable tragedies have nothing to do with the supernatural at all.

Even if you are a Beyonder, you have only obtained one chance to change things.

- Whether you can truly change them depends on whether you seize that rope.

> **Lore:** Every Beyonder can be powerful, yet at the same time is a pitiable creature accompanied by madness.
