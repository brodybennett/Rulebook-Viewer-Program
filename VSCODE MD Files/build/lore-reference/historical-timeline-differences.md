# Differences in the Lord of the Mysteries Historical Timeline {#historical-timeline-differences}

This section summarizes the setting’s major **Epochs** and key organizations for campaign reference. For system definitions of **Beyonders**, **Pathways**, **Sequences**, and **Beyonder Characteristics**, see [[The Beyonder System]], [[Chapter 10: Sequences]], and [[Beyonder Characteristics]]. For artifact terminology, see [[Sealed Artifacts and Containment]].

> **GM Note:** This material is presented as setting reference. Some entries originated from external compilations and may be incomplete or inconsistent.

## Epochs {#historical-timeline-differences-epochs}

### First Epoch: Chaos Era {#historical-timeline-differences-first-epoch-chaos-era}

- The two **Primordials** split from the Original Creator (**God Almighty** and the **Celestial Worthy**).
- The split **Outer Deities** became entangled in mutual struggle; ordinary beings could not participate.
- Few survivors remained on land.
- Outcome:
  - All Outer Deities were sealed outside Earth’s barrier.
  - The Celestial Worthy and God Almighty fell together.
  - Their Beyonder Characteristics shattered, separated, and fused with surface creatures, forming various races.
- This transition ushers in the Second Epoch.

### Second Epoch: Mythic Age {#historical-timeline-differences-second-epoch-mythic-age}

- Tone: a “classic fantasy” world (elves, werewolves, vampires, mind dragons, giants).
- **Beyonder** power was at its peak and not secret.
- At **Sequence 2**, one could already begin to be called a “god” (in-setting usage).
- Eight major ancient-god factions:
  - Sanguine Ancestor **Lilith**
  - **Giant King**
  - **Elf King**
  - **Dragon of Imagination**
  - **Phoenix Ancestor**
  - **Mutant King**
  - **Demon Wolf of Destruction**
  - **Demon Monarch Farbauti**
- Humans functioned as near-slaves; the **Ancient Sun God** secretly built human organizations and prepared to slay the ancient gods.
- End of epoch:
  - The Ancient Sun God defeated the ancient gods one by one, proclaimed Himself the true Original Creator, and converted believers by “reclaiming stolen authority.”
  - The Third Epoch begins with the Ancient Sun God as the orthodox god.

**Advancement notes (Second Epoch specifics):**
- There were no potions and no concept of rituals for advancement.
- Many Beyonder species “ate whatever they could,” leaving most in a half-mad state (though some remained rational).
- The ancient gods were not necessarily **Sequence 0**.
  - Example given: the Phoenix Ancestor is described as a composite existence of the non-adjacent **Death + Door Pathways**.
- Many Pathways were sparse or vacant:
  - With 8 ancient gods, even assuming “2 Pathways each,” only ~16 Pathways are represented.
  - The text claims ~6 Pathways were completely vacant.

> **GM Note:** If you want a high-fantasy “becoming a god” style campaign, the source text recommends this epoch, but also notes related content may be incomplete.

### Third Epoch: Unified Era {#historical-timeline-differences-third-epoch-unified-era}

- The Ancient Sun God unified the era alongside eight **Angel Kings** under His command.
- Secretly, other faiths persisted (e.g., **Evernight Goddess**, **God of Combat**, **Earth Mother**), led by various Angel Kings.

**Faction play (campaign hook):**
- If a campaign is set here, playing “hidden-existence” faith factions (e.g., Evernight Church) opposing Ancient Sun God orthodoxy can be a strong conflict driver.

**Governance and belief:**
- Not all territories were directly governed by a single administration.
- The eight Angel Kings each oversaw sectors; people in those regions also believed in the local Angel King.
- The Angel Kings were considered to share the Ancient Sun God’s “anchor.”
- The **Dark Angel** had the most believers, regarded as the “other side” of the Ancient Sun God; this was tacitly accepted by the gods.

**Late Third Epoch collapse:**
- The Ancient Sun God attempted a “resurrection” plan to resolve the Primordial awakening within His body.
- Other gods and angels betrayed Him during this process, leading to His fall.
- The **Forsaken Land of the Gods** lost the sun.
- The former **Wind Angel**, **Blazing Angel**, and **Wisdom Angel** devoured the Ancient Sun God’s corpse and became gods one after another.
- The world entered the Fourth Epoch:
  - Six gods formed an alliance.
  - Four **Sequence 0** stood on their own.
  - The **True Creator** emerged “out of nowhere.”

### Fourth Epoch: Age of Empires {#historical-timeline-differences-fourth-epoch-age-of-empires}

**Major powers (predecessors of Fifth Epoch nations):**
- **Trunsoest Empire** of the Night Emperor
- **Solomon Empire** (Solomon)
- **Tudor Empire** of the Blood Emperor
- Southern continent territory of the **Underworld Emperor (Death)**
- An alliance jointly formed by six gods:
  - **Lord of Storms**
  - **Eternal Blazing Sun**
  - **God of Knowledge and Wisdom**
  - **Earth Mother**
  - **God of Combat**
  - **Evernight Goddess**

**Notable lineages and houses appear (examples listed):**
- Antigonus family
- Zaratul family
- Abraham family (“Mr. Door’s” line; not including Amon himself)
- Amon family
- and others

**Key events (compressed):**
- Solomon resurrected and returned as **Black Emperor Pathway, Sequence 0**.
- The Night Emperor and Blood Emperor neared losing their **Sequence 1** Characteristics:
  - Night Emperor switched to **Justiciar Pathway, Sequence 0**.
  - Blood Emperor forcibly switched Pathways, becoming dual-Pathway **Black Emperor + Red Priest**, resulting in a half-mad incident.
- Late Fourth Epoch:
  - The **God of Crafts** (identified here as the **God of Steam and Machinery**) forcibly advanced to **Sequence 0** due to the appearance of the **Hidden Sage** (described as the activated **Uniqueness** of the Mystery Pryer Pathway).
  - This shifted “six gods” into “seven gods,” breaking the balance.
- **War of the Four Emperors:**
  - The three emperors other than the Underworld Emperor fell together.
  - The Underworld Emperor sought to become an Old One and accommodated the **Red Priest Uniqueness**, becoming half-mad.
  - Together with the **Primordial Demoness**, he unleashed the **Pale Disaster**, devastating living beings.
  - Ultimately:
    - The Primordial Demoness was heavily wounded and did not initially awaken until mid–Fifth Epoch.
    - **Death** fell.
    - The seven gods went their separate ways.
- Aftermath:
  - Former territories of Trunsoest/Tudor/Solomon supported new nobles and were divided into nations including:
    - **Kingdom of Loen** (capital: Backlund)
    - **Intis Republic**
    - **Feynapotter**
    - **Feysac Empire**
    - and others

### Fifth Epoch: Victorian Era {#historical-timeline-differences-fifth-epoch-victorian-era}

- Tone: modern Victorian / steampunk; this is the primary stage of the original Lord of the Mysteries timeline.
- Governance:
  - Jointly governed by seven gods.
  - Past deities withdrew as hidden existences.
- Supernatural visibility:
  - Beyonder matters retreat behind the scenes.
  - Beyonder power is no longer at its peak.
- “Mid-Sequence” terminology shift:
  - Fourth Epoch: only **Sequence 6** could be called mid-Sequence.
  - Fifth Epoch: even **Sequence 7** counts as mid-Sequence.
- Deities no longer walk the earth:
  - The seven gods moved their divine kingdoms to the **Astral World**, filling Earth’s barrier.
- Two transmigrators arrived one after another (**Roselle**, **Klein**).
- Naming note:
  - The God of Crafts was renamed the **God of Steam and Machinery** due to Roselle’s influence (by oracle).
- Apocalypse pressure (novel baseline):
  - Outer Deities are nearing a breakthrough of the barrier; world-destruction approaches.
