# Extra: Rank Suppression {#rank-suppression}

## Overview {#rank-suppression-overview}

> **Lore:** In *Lord of the Mysteries*, as a **Beyonder** advances in **Sequence**, their life-form may transform and gain divinity. Higher-ranked beings typically exert overwhelming pressure on lower-ranked beings.

This section defines **Status/Rank** tiers and the rules for **Rank Suppression** (the mechanical advantages a higher **Status/Rank** gains over a lower one in specific matchups).

> **GM Note:** Terminology such as “demigod/saint” is not consistently standardized across sources; this document uses the most common and easily understood usage.

## Status/Rank Tiers {#rank-suppression-status-rank-tiers}

Below are **Sequence** tiers that may be treated as **Status/Rank**.

1. **Ordinary Person** (not a Beyonder): no Status/Rank.
2. **Low-Sequence Beyonder** (Sequence 9–8): no explicit Status/Rank.
3. **Mid-Sequence Beyonder** (Sequence 7–5): no explicit Status/Rank.
   - Generally: at this tier, when facing Beyonder items of a lower Sequence level than their own, they have better tolerance for enduring negative effects than other people.
4. **Demigod/Saint** (Sequence 4–3): **Demigod Status/Rank**.
   - Possesses divinity.
   - Lifespan significantly increased (average **300+ years**), roughly comparable to Moon Pathway Sequence 7; Moon Pathway Demigods can live even longer.
   - When facing Beyonder items **below the Demigod tier**: for the Demigod themself only, the negative effects of those items are **halved**.
   - Note: only at **Sequence 3** does a Beyonder begin to be able to write their own **Honorific Name**, and receive responses within the scope of a city.
5. **Angel** (Sequence 2–1): a complete Mythical Creature.
   - Able to open Mythical Form without cost; possesses complete divinity.
   - When facing a Beyonder item lower than them by **one Status/Rank**, the effects they suffer are equal to those when a Demigod faces a non-Demigod Beyonder item.
   - Can listen to followers’ prayers; can respond to prayers globally (except specially isolated locations, e.g. the Forsaken Land of the Gods, unless currently inside it or bypassing the restriction by other means).
6. **Angel King** (various methods surpassing Sequence 1 without reaching Sequence 0) (see also [[Unqueness and Sefirah Reference]]):
   - Examples include: accommodating a **Uniqueness**, multiple portions of Sequence 1 characteristics, or mastering a **Sefirah**.
   - Sequence 1 Beyonder characteristics have at most **three** portions.
   - Sefirah interaction: only within the range the Sefirah can affect, the Beyonder’s Status/Rank temporarily **+1**, and they are treated as an Angel King.
7. **Sequence 0** (ascender who has obtained three Sequence 1 characteristics and the corresponding Uniqueness):
   - Possesses authority that can truly be called divine; usually can easily create planet-level disasters.
   - Can respond to prayers globally and within the scope of an entire star system.
8. **Half an Old One**: at least accommodated the Uniqueness of two Pathways, and at the same time mastered a Sefirah.
9. **Old One**: formed by accommodating all corresponding Uniquenesses of all adjacent Pathways, possessing at least one Sequence 1 characteristic for each adjacent Pathway, and mastering a Sefirah.
   - Usually able to easily create galaxy-level or higher disasters.
   - Prayer range: the entire universe.
10. **Pillar**: ruler/supporter of the entire universe.
   - The number of Pillars is usually limited.
   - Even if a Pillar loses Pillar power, they are usually still the strongest existence among Old Ones.

## When Rank Suppression Applies {#rank-suppression-when-rank-suppression-applies}

Starting from **Sequence 4**, Beyonders begin to gain **Status/Rank**.

- Including Beyonders with no Status/Rank, each difference of **one Status/Rank** represents an “insurmountable gulf” in combat.
- However, **Rank Suppression** does **not** apply to all Sequence gaps.

**Rank Suppression matchups (where these rules apply):**
- Sequence **9–5** (including ordinary people) vs **Sequence 4**.
- **Sequence 4** vs **Sequence 2**.
- **Sequence 2** vs an **Angel King**.
- An **Angel King** vs **Sequence 0**.

**Non-example:**
- A Sequence 6 does **not** exert Rank Suppression on a Sequence 8; their gap is already large enough, and both are in the “no Status/Rank” category for suppression purposes.

**Status/Rank grouping note:**
- Sequence **9–5** (including ordinary people) are treated as the **same Status/Rank** for suppression purposes; they almost have no divinity and cannot produce Rank Suppression.

## Effects of Higher Status/Rank {#rank-suppression-effects-of-higher-status-rank}

In a Rank Suppression matchup, when a higher-Status/Rank Beyonder faces a lower one, the higher side typically gains the following benefits.

- **Defense:** All three Defense Ratings gain **+10** base value:
  - [[Physical Defense]]
  - Constitution (CON) Defense
  - Willpower (WIL) Defense  
  (See also [[Other Defenses]].)

- **Attacks vs lower Sequences:**
  - Attack-related skill checks: **+3** (see [[Scaling and High-Sequence Additions]] for the “actual +5” case).
  - Damage: **+1d6**.

- **Action Protection:** Gain **two layers** of **Action Protection** (see [[Action Protection]]).

- **Restricting-type abilities (opposed checks):**
  - Against restricting-type abilities (examples given: “Tight Shut”, Moon’s Abyss Shackles, Pain Torment), you gain a **+5** bonus on the relevant opposed checks.

- **Anti-divination:**
  - Against targets lower than you by **one Status/Rank**, you inherently have an anti-divination effect.

- **Sanity / Rationality:**
  - If the Sanity / Rationality check you suffer comes from a Status/Rank lower than yours, apply a modifier to the **1d20** roll:
    - Lower by **1 Status/Rank**: final roll **-4**
    - Lower by **2 Status/Ranks**: final roll **-8**
    - And so on  
  (See [[Sanity / Rationality]].)

- **Death Pathway / undead special rule:** See [[Death Pathway: Undead Command]].

> **GM Note:** In [[High-Sequence Vitality Calculation]] / [[Vitality]] rules, the Vitality (HP) gained from each Status/Rank increase is doubled.

### Action Protection {#rank-suppression-action-protection}

You gain **two layers** of **Action Protection**.

**Trigger:**
- If an ability whose Status/Rank is **lower than yours** attempts to reduce your:
  - Free Action
  - Swift Action
  - spellcasting action
  - attack action
  - movement action  
  …you may use divinity to resist the loss of actions.

**Limits and selection:**
- This protection has **no usage limit**; the stated upper limit is that it can negate reductions to up to **two actions**.
- If one ability would affect multiple action types, **one layer** of Action Protection can protect against **only one** of those reductions.
- Which specific action an Action Protection layer protects is decided by the higher-Status/Rank being themself.

**What it does *not* protect against:**
- Action Protection does **not** include binding-type abilities (example given: Moon’s Abyss Shackles).
  - These do not cause you to “lose actions”; they make you “unable to perform actions”.
  - Your actions are not lost—only prevented—so Action Protection cannot negate them.
  - You must make the corresponding escape check to avoid the binding.

**Free/Swift Action special handling:**
- If you suffer an effect such as “each round you can only use one Free Action”, you may use **one** Action Protection to negate this effect **once**.
- A Free Action’s Action Protection is equivalent to **three Free Action uses**. Swift Action is the same and likewise provides **three uses**.
  - If a negative status reduces one Free/Swift action, **three** reductions are required to consume one protection of your Free/Swift actions.
  - If it specifically states “can only use one Free Action”, you can use **two** Free Action protections to resist this effect a total of **two** times.
  - Only when your Free Action protections are used up, and a **third** “one Free Action” limitation is stacked onto you, will your Free Action count truly be affected (you begin to be able to use only one Free Action).

[[UNCLEAR: Action Protection is described as having “no usage limit” but also as being “consumed” by stacked reductions; when/how (if ever) protections refresh is not specified.]]

### Death Pathway: Undead Command {#rank-suppression-death-pathway-undead-command}

This benefit is limited to the **Death Pathway** and **undead creatures**.

If you are an undead creature and are facing undead creatures that are lower than you by **one Status/Rank**, then—so long as:
- they are **in front of you**, and
- there are **no other undead** present whose Status/Rank is **higher than yours or equal to yours**,

…if you issue commands to undead creatures lower than you by one Status/Rank or more, they are unable to disobey and must obey completely, even if ordered to commit suicide.

While in this state:
- If that undead creature dares to do anything to you, **all of its checks -4**.

This also applies if the undead creature is a Death Pathway Beyonder (provided they have advanced to **Sequence 7** and are regarded as an undead creature).

Conversely:
- If you face a Death Pathway that is higher than you by **one Status/Rank**, this situation will also occur.

Additional related case:
- If the other party is **not** higher than you by one Status/Rank, but only by **+1 Sequence level**, then they do not have absolute command authority over you, but:
  - you still suffer **all checks -4**, and
  - your body unconsciously trembles (this can be concealed).

> **GM Note:** Even without being lower by one Status/Rank, usually, with only a gap of two Sequence levels, the words of the higher-ranked still have a powerful binding effect on the lower-ranked.

## Edge Cases and Using Lower-Rank Tools {#rank-suppression-edge-cases-and-lower-rank-tools}

### Lower-Status/Rank using higher-Status/Rank items/abilities

Even if an existence is lower Status/Rank, if they hold a Beyonder item whose Status/Rank is equal to yours or higher (e.g. a Demigod-tier or Angel-tier item), then **limited to the use of that item**:
- it has normal bonuses against you, or may even gain bonuses that suppress you in reverse.

Demigod skills obtained through recording and other means also enjoy Rank Suppression effects:
- When you use a Demigod skill to attack, you can enjoy all of the Rank Suppression attack benefits.
- When facing theft, so long as the target is your Demigod ability, you also enjoy the benefits brought by the Defense bonuses above.

### Higher-Status/Rank using lower-Status/Rank items/benefits in high-rank combat

If a Demigod uses only a **Sequence 5-tier** Beyonder item to fight in a Demigod-tier battle:
- all abilities related to that Sequence 5 item suffer Rank Suppression, and
- other Demigods facing that item gain Rank Suppression benefits against it.

Practical note stated by the source text:
- Starting from Demigod, Sequence 5-tier Beyonder items are already quite limited.
- At present, only a Black Emperor Pathway Sequence 4 Demigod can compensate for this gap by increasing the item’s Sequence level, allowing the Sequence 5 item to function normally.

If, during the Demigod stage, a Sequence 5 ability grants you **additional actions**, then:
- when you perform those extra actions obtained through that mid/low-Sequence item, those extra actions suffer Rank Suppression effects (regardless of whether you yourself are a Demigod).

If a Sequence 5 item provides **bonuses to yourself** (example given: Holy Covenant increasing STR by 6 and DEX by 6), then checks are calculated separately:
- One calculation is for your own damage, which does **not** suffer Rank Suppression.
- One calculation separately computes the damage provided by the item:
  - the additional STR damage dice gained from those +6 STR must subtract your original STR damage dice, then make a separate check;
  - this separate check suffers Rank Suppression.

### Low-Sequence assistance that does not directly affect the opponent

Only when the benefits brought by a mid/low-Sequence Beyonder item (or assistance) do **not involve another Demigod at all** will they not suffer the relevant Rank Suppression handling.

Example given:
- A Sequence 6 Spectator hypnotizes you to keep you awake.
  - If this hypnosis is used to resist another Demigod’s entering dreams, that resistance effect is equivalent to Sequence 6:
    - when facing a Demigod, the effect will be halved or almost none, **or**
    - an additional WIL opposed check is made, with the opposing Demigod gaining the Rank Suppression bonus to determine whether the hypnosis takes effect.
  - If the Sequence 6 Spectator truly causes no influence on the other Demigod’s checks and only improves the hypnotized Demigod’s state slightly (e.g., a +1 or +2 bonus), does not increase damage, and is not used as a shield to resist damage:
    - there is no need to calculate additional checks/bonuses for Rank Suppression.

> **GM Note:** Upon reaching Demigod, trying to use Sequence 5 or lower power to intervene in a Demigod battle is generally not advisable: it often costs significant effort with little result and is better used outside Demigod-tier combat.

## Scaling and High-Sequence Additions {#rank-suppression-scaling-and-high-sequence-additions}

If you are higher than the target by **multiple Status/Ranks** (example given: a Demigod facing an Angel King):
- all advantages gained by the higher side are **doubled**.

Special note on “advantage effects in special states”:
- The advantages of Status/Rank also enjoy advantage effects in special states; i.e., the “+3” attack-check bonus against lower Sequences is treated as **actual +5** in those cases.

### Sequence 1 Special Skill: Convergence Law Control {#rank-suppression-convergence-law-control}

Upon reaching the **Sequence 1** tier, against existences lower than yourself in Status/Rank, you also gain an additional skill: control the Beyonder Characteristic Convergence Law.

**Special Skill (Convergence Law Control):**
- Use a spellcasting action to control the Beyonder Characteristic Convergence Law.
- You attract all existences of the **same Sequence as you**, among the targets you designate within the range of an entire city, to you.

Timing note:
- If the distance spans an entire city, it takes **one full round**.

Adjacent-Pathway limitation:
- If you yourself are a Sequence 1 Angel of a Pathway, using this ability on other Angels of adjacent Pathways can only serve to draw their attention.

For the concept of adjacent Pathways, see [[MISSING REF: Chapter 16: Explanation of Switching Sequences]].

### Sequence 0 and Beyond {#rank-suppression-sequence-0-and-beyond}

**Dual-Pathway Sequence 0 advantage:**
- Upon reaching **Sequence 0**, for each additional adjacent Pathway Uniqueness you accommodate, or adjacent Pathway Sequence 1 characteristic you accommodate (becoming a dual-Pathway Sequence 0), your Status/Rank can be **+1** when facing other Sequence 0s.

Old One vs Sequence 0:
- Old One Status/Rank and Sequence 0 Status/Rank have an essential gap.
- Only when an Old One Status/Rank faces Sequence 0, the overall advantages gained are **tripled** (not doubled).

Pillar vs Old One:
- A Pillar Status/Rank facing an Old One gains advantages **doubled**.

## Draft Material: Becoming a Deity {#rank-suppression-becoming-a-deity-draft}

> **GM Note:** The source text marks the following material as “under revision and not yet complete; for reference only.”

Stated framework:
- From Sequence 4 onward you can obtain divinity and are regarded as an incomplete Mythical Creature.
- From Sequence 2 onward you are regarded as a complete Mythical Creature.
- Sequence 0 is considered a true deity.  
(See also [[Chapter 11: Manifesting Mythical Creature Form]].)

Mental-state premise (as written):
- As Sequence rises, sanity gradually enters a crisis; the “Primordial” within may awaken.
- Taking Sequence 2 as a node: higher Sequences do not necessarily mean stronger in every respect; mental state may worsen and require maintaining sanity balance.

This chapter’s stated purpose:
- Before truly becoming a deity, gather followers and obtain “anchors” to stabilize sanity (even “false anchors”).
- Without these, advancing to Sequence 2 may cause you to lose control on the spot.  
(See also [[Rituals and Followers]] and [[Gods and Faith]].)

### Drafting an Honorific Name {#rank-suppression-drafting-an-honorific-name}

This procedure assumes you intend to advance to Sequence 2 and want to reduce the risk of losing control.

At Sequence 3, in addition to the ritual:
- You also need to spread faith.
- Followers may chant your **Honorific Name** when necessary.
- You can receive prayers and use Beyonder powers remotely at the location of the prayer.

**Honorific Name drafting process (as written):**
1. Summarize your character sheet’s life experiences; find at least one unique trait unlikely for anyone else to match.
2. Use that trait as the core; write the Honorific Name by stacking “key phrases” until it filters to only you.
3. In practice, a normal Sequence 3–1 Honorific Name is usually **4 parts or 5 parts**, and must include one’s true name or a false identity name, to accurately filter among all Beyonder existences.

Three-part name restriction (as written):
- Three-part Honorific Names usually fit cases where:
  1) the owner has obtained Uniqueness or a Sefirot, **or**
  2) the owner is subordinate to/attendant of someone who has Uniqueness or a Sefirot (borrowing that level).

Examples are discussed in [[Names and Honorific Titles of Mystical Deities and Angels]].

> **Lore (example provided by the source text; “do not plagiarize”):**
> “The all-knowing book yet to be filled,  
> The elusive two-faced demon,  
> The girl who sees into hearts, the saint who stirs men’s hearts.  
> Backlund’s most brilliant red-and-blue gemstone.  
> Cute and playful, Luo Xi · Meme.”

[[UNCLEAR: The Honorific Name example analysis is truncated mid-sentence in the provided text (ends at “humanity and …”).]]

## Uniqueness and Sefirah Reference {#rank-suppression-uniqueness-and-sefirah-reference}

**Uniqueness** and **Sefirah/Sefirot** are key concepts for advancement beyond Sequence 1.

- **Uniqueness:** described as the “core” of a Pathway and key to mastering an entire Pathway of Sequences.
  - Only by possessing the Uniqueness does one have “absolute sovereignty” over that Pathway, including manipulating knowledge contained in potion advancements and (to an extent) regulating abilities displayed by that Pathway.

- **Sefirah:** described as the core by which adjacent Pathways ascend from Sequence 0 to become an Old One.
  - Sefirah influence can temporarily increase Status/Rank by **+1** within its effective range (treated as Angel King).

Additional restrictions (as written):
- For Beyonders below the level of an Old One, it is impossible to summon/copy Uniqueness via historical projection (indirect summoning may be possible via summoning an empowered holder).
- Anything involving Uniqueness cannot be affected by “Restart” or “Reverse Time” abilities; anything related to Uniqueness is invalid under those effects.
  - Example given: if someone who has accommodated Uniqueness participates in a battle, then from the time they arrived, fate can no longer be “Restarted”.

> **Lore (analogy included in the source text):** A sphere analogy is used: shell = Sefirot, flesh = Beyonder Characteristics, core = Uniqueness. This describes a “split” and the process an Old One reverses by re-accommodating key parts. (See also [[Beyonder Characteristics]].)

### Accommodating Uniqueness

**Requirement stated:**
- You must become **Sequence 1** to accommodate Uniqueness.

**Method (as written):**
- Hold a simplified ritual for advancing to Sequence 0, then ingest the Uniqueness “as if it were a potion”.
  - It is “simplified” because accommodation ritual requirements are lower than a full Sequence 0 advancement ritual.
  - It is not mandatory to accommodate Uniqueness before advancing to Sequence 0; you can advance directly and accommodate during advancement. Pre-accommodation is often used when one cannot meet advancement conditions for a long time.

**Adjacent-Pathway restriction (as written):**
- Before becoming Sequence 0, you cannot accommodate the Uniqueness of an adjacent Pathway; otherwise you will become half-mad.

[[UNCLEAR: The text introduces “Uniqueness List” entries and “known holders”, but no list/entries are included in this section.]]

### Benefits of accommodating any Uniqueness (as written)

**Accommodation effect:**
- Your Status/Rank rises to an **Angel King**.
- You can use **Sequence 0** Beyonder abilities at **half effect**, rounding **up**.

**Pathway adjustment:**
- You begin to be able to adjust parts of this Pathway.
- Adjusting takes **1 [[Full-Round Action]]**.
- Adjustable content includes:
  1. Any ability effect can be reproduced at full effect through recording/simulation and similar means; conversely, you can halve an effect.
  2. Add/remove the knowledge gained when advancing in this Pathway.
  3. Make an “all-channel broadcast” to Beyonders of this Pathway, delivering your voice to all Beyonders of the Pathway in a manner similar to responding to prayers; you can also decide that some Beyonders cannot hear it.
     - Beyonders of the same Sequence level as you in the same Pathway/adjacent Pathways can hear it with a Spiritual Intuition check even if you did not broadcast to them.
  4. Other GM-approved content.
     - Generally does not include increasing damage, etc.
     - You are adjusting effects or adding logically consistent effects; you cannot increase original effects to an abnormal degree.

> **GM Note:** The source text states these benefits “may contain errors” and invites revision based on original-work text.
